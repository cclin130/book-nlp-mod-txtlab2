Neville sighed looking at Lily. She had fallen from quite a height. She was losing blood quickly and her wounds were serious. Were she not expecting her wounds and blood loss would not be life threatening. The problem was she had been expecting and the fall had caused an early labor.
"Neville," Archibald exclaimed,"I cannot lose her."
"I know Archie," Neville said,"I know"He sighed again.
"Archie," he said,"Lily's labor started. Her wounds are fresh and the height she fell from was dangerous."
"Oh GOD!"
"Calm yourself," Neville said,"But I will have to operate to get the baby out. A natural delivery will cause her to bleed out and that can mean death for her or the baby or both."Neville hurried into Lily's bedroom. Archibald had to wait outside. He paced the floor. After moments but what seemed like hours he heard a tiny cry and then another.
"Archie," Neville said reappearing,"You have a tiny daughter. Lily named her Mary"
"A-and Lily"
"She'll be alright. I gave her something for her wounds and the bleeding is under control. Come see your baby"When Archibald saw his baby for the first time he knew everything would be alright.
