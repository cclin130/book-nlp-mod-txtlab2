Believe in the Majick
Mary drove up to the pace that had once been her home. The place she was sent after the death of her parents. Misselthwaite Manor. It doesn't sound like the greatest place in the world but it was. On the grounds was a garden,a secret garden. The garden was not only a secret,it was majick.
The majick was for all who came in contact with it. For Mary it made her happy. For most of her young life she was very unhappy,but the garden made her smile.
Colin was born early after his mother had a fall,and she died shortly after. He spent his eleven years thinking his father hated him. Also his tough birth left him weak and unable to walk. The garden made him well. The first place he walked was in that garden,his mother's garden.
For Dickon,it was something he loved. He did not have much to complain about but he found friends. Mary often said Dickon was the first friend she ever had,and he was happy to be that for her.
Ben was also a very unhappy person,but he had been one of the people to make the garden in the first place. He agreed to help the children recreate it. It made him happy. For the time in many years he was happy once again.
The garden was majick for sure. That was one thing Mary believed in.
Now back at the place she once called home,she wondered if the majick was still there,if the garden was still there,if happiness still remained. If there was something for her to believe in.
