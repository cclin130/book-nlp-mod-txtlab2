Death is weak. It can only do so much.
It cannot kill memories.
It cannot destroy love.
It can only take away the physical but the soul remains. Everywhere I look there are memories of the one who loved me and the one that I loved.
She died giving life to a new person and in my baby's eyes I see her.
Lily was light and she still is. When I hear raindrops falling against the house I know it is Lily. She used to love the rain. When I see the sunlight dance in the window of a brand new day I know it's Lily. She isn't gone. She's just dead. She will never be gone.Every single day my thoughts are of her. In my dreams I dance with her. In my thoughts I speak with her. In my heart I hold her to me. She is but a breath away and because of her I breath. I love her and I always will.
