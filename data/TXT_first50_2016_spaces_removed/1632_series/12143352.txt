Sun arched her back in a long stretch,squinting as the harsh greenleaf sunlight met her emerald gaze. "You're awake." A familiar,loud,voice sent a trickle of fear down her spine. She turned and faced Forest. "Yes...I apologize for waking up so late,I was out hunting until way past Moon-High last night,and-" She was cut off by forest's cruel laughter.
"I don't care what you were doing. We are moving today and you are holding us up!"
"Forest,please listen." She begged. "I-"
Forest extended his claws and sliced open the skin on her nose. Blood trickled from the wound. "Next time I won't be so easy-going." He growled. "Now get ready to go before I give you some real wounds to think about."
Sun didn't have to be told twice. She turned and sprinted away from her father.
After swallowing a scrawny rat,Sun padded towards the group of rogues that she called family. The pack consisted of her mother Sand and two younger brothers Dusk and Rock,her father Forest (the leader),an elderly cat named Rose,and two other fully grown cats named Ripple and Sky. Her mother was sand colored with a green eyes,and her brothers were both brown/gray with ice blue eyes. Rose was pale pink with purple eyes,Ripple was silver with deep blue eyes and a circular pattern in dark gray,and Sky was blue with white speckles and gray eyes. Forest was dark brown with a black tail,black legs with menacing brown eyes,while Sun herself was golden-yellow with a white muzzle and underbelly. She dipped her head to them politely,but sat down a good distance away from them. Heartbeats later her father appeared and they set of once again on another journey to a new home.
