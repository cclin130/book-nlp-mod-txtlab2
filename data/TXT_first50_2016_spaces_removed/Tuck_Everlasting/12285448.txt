Poems about a butterfly
This for my Aunt Sarah Alcarz
Rest in PeaceLife is like a butterflyYou are born,You livedAnd you die.For my Aunt SaraShe livedTo live for the fullest,they sayShe goes through lifeThe moment she is bornShe laughsShe playsShe danceAnd she love.Sara you are moreThan life itself.God bless youWe loveBy you.Rejoice,that your soulIs up to heaven.You have fought your battleAgainst Cancer.Yet your face tells meThat you are satisfiedThat we came to see you.We came for youEven when time is shortTo show usEven we have to live for the fullestThere is no need to fussLife is like a butterflyYou are bornYou livedYou dieDo not be afraid of deathBut to the unlived lifeYou just have to liveGoodbyeAunt SaraWe love you.
