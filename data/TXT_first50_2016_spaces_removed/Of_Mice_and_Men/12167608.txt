So I had to rewrite a scene in Of Mice and Men for class where it took place in modern day time when there's less discrimination.
Where Curley's wife's name is Frusta (from the Latin word Frustra,meaning vain),for less confusion
Word count:191
"Hey,let go. Let go of my hair! Hey!" Frusta shouted. Lennie,panicked,covered her mouth with his big paw.
"Please be quiet! Don't make a noise."
Frusta struggled more,but Lennie kept his hand clamped over her mouth.
"Stop struggling! Just be quiet. I want to tend the rabbits."
With a muffled yell,Frusta kicked her leg up high right into Lennie's hand. When Lennie retreated his hand from pain,she jumped away from Lennie so she could face him in a fighting stance.
"Ha," she gloated,breathing hard. "I took kung fu for seven years as a child. I guess I still have some in me."
There was apparent fear on Lennie's face now.
"I didn't mean to hurt you. PLease don't tell George. The rabbitsâ€¦. I just wanted to touch your hair for a little longer," Lennie got up and backed into the far wall of the barn.
Frusta relaxed a little bit,seeing the fear and sincerity on Lennie's face.
"Okay. I won't tell George. I won't tell anyone. I'll let it slide. This time. Just be careful next time,alright?" Lennie nodded,relief in his face.
