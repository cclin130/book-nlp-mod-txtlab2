'Of Mice and Men':Creative Writing By Celina Ferrari Nguyen
It's been 5 weeks since Lennie died. It's been 5 weeks since I los' my best friend. It's been 5 weeks since Curley's wife died. In just that one faithful day,two lives were lost. Nothin' s been the same since. We still work an' all but I jus' can't get over the fact that the big ol' goof isn't here with me anymore.
The voice of someone familiar approaches. It's Slim. "George! What ya doin'?! Work's over! Let's go! Nancy's waiting." he shouts. It struck me. Nancy. Who is she?... It's the girl I met the night after Lennie died. Gorgeous girl,dark brown hair with em' green eyes. She's as kind as Mother Mary an' works as a waitress in 'Ol' Buck's Bar'.
"O.K. Slim!" I shouted back. He comes running towards me like a racehorse.
"You done?" he asks me.
"Yeah" I answered without hesitation.
"Then,let's go!' he said.
"O.K.,O.K." I tol' him.
Ever since that day at the pool with Lennie,Slim's been there for me. Goin' out for drinks with me on weekends,jumping from cathouse to cathouse. Since then,we finally became good friends.
We head out to the water station,freshen up and leave for 'Ol' Buck's Bar'.
As we enter,I search for Nancy,while Slim gets us a table. An' like always,he's lookin' around for a girl to have fun with before setting down.
I finally see her. There's no way anyone can miss her,she's waiting another man's table. I stare for a bit,seein' if the guy's doin' somethin' he shouldn't. As she's done,she turns around,she sees me. I see her. We gaze at each other for a moment. She signals me,telling me to wait. I do. At the corner of my eye,Slim waves at me. I walk to him,while Nancy walks away.
"Did ya see her?" he asked.
"If I didn't,would I've taken this long to walk here? I replied
"Well it don't matter now. Cause she comin' over here now." he told me.
"Hey sugar." she says facin' me
"Hey good lookin'." Slim says lookin' at her.
I elbow him.
"Ow! What's that for?" he asks me.
"Hey Nance" I say.
Slim stares at me wonderin' what he did wrong,though he knew. I was goin' to ask if she wanted to be my girl. I thought to myself,it's time an' I know she's been wantin' this. "What would ya want to drink?" she asks us both.
"I'll take a beer,an' he'll take one too." Slim says for us both.
"No problem hon'. " She says.
I signal her,pointing to the door. She follows me. She grabs my hand an' I squeezed her tight. We walk out. I build up my courage an' ask her. "Nance,I was wonderin' if you'd want to be my girl?"
"Oh my gosh! Yes! Yes! You goof! Why wouldn't I?" she answers me. I can't stop smiling,neither can she. We stop for a small kiss. I carry her in the bar an' I shout. "She said yes!" Slim starts clapping an' smiling. An' somehow I knew that Lennie was too.
