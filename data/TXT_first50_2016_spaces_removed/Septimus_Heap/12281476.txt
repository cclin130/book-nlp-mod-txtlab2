A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. The site is dead so I wrote a load of nonsense. I'll finish In Charge soon,I swear,I just have writer's block. This is a Modern AU obviously. I'll leave you to imagine the details,but Sep was taken as a baby,put in foster care,and taken in by Marcia when he was ten. He doesn't know about the Heaps,but for this stories sake,they found out his real name through some files but couldn't find the family. If I continued this the plot would be Sep finding his family through Jenna,who he is texting accidentally. It's all platonic. But it's a oneshot,so imagine the ending for yourselves:)
I put this in America cause I didn't want to mess up the UK school system,sorry. Also sorry about the voodoo thing,I was just told it's NOT illegal,so pretend for me?
Bold- Septimus;Italics- Jenna;Underline- Jo-Jo
SSS- Syrah (made up middle S name) Syara;Drama Queen- Lucy
1:02pm:What are the chances of me going to jail if I make a voodoo doll and smash it with a hammer?
1:07:VOODOO'S ILLEGAL! 100% so stop while your ahead
1:08:Be quiet,Drama Queen. If you had to sit through class with 409 sending you notes about deforestation and screaming about wasting every time you sharpen your pencil you would want to smash him with a hammer too.
1:08:Also,you're not your. This is why everyone is concerned about your education.
1:09 Hey,I'm extremely well educated. And while I am guilty of hammer smashing myself,try to refrain until he's dead. Also,not Drama Queen.
1:09:Is this Beetle then? I didn't know you smashed people with a hammer before! What else are you hiding?! Is this like the cannon ball incident?
1:10:No,I am not a beetle either,but he sounds worrying. And you probably have the wrong number.
1:12:Really? Sorry,I just got this thing.
1:13:No problem.
2:34:Since I don't know how to sew or knit or however you make voodoo dolls and Drama Queen won't help me,I just hit him with my calculator. He'll be out for 10-30 minutes according to SSS.
2:37:Wrong number again. And how did you knock him out with a CALCULATOR?
2:39:I know I just thought I'd update you on whether or not I'm going to jail. My calculator is really huge with lots of buttons.
2:40:Good for you. Give it about two years and you'll be in orange,considering what I know about you. You sound like my brother. Also,why a calculator of all things?
2:42:Is your brother a voodoo doll maker or a head smasher? Orange is a lovely colour and they don't let us keep weapons which is ironic.
2:44:Neither. Orange is a stupid color and why is it ironic? Weapons shouldn't be allowed in school.
2:45:You terrible person. You disgust me. Orange is a wonderful color,why do you hate it so? The sun is orange. 
2:45:DO YOU HATE THE SUN?
2:46:NO I DO NOT HATE THE SUN.
2:46:I just don't like that stupid neon orange. And you didn't answer my question.
2:47:YOU DISGUST ME. I go to military school. I bet you're one of those people who wear all black and sulk in corners and have tattoos and bad posture. And strange piercings.
2:47:Oh I see. No but you just described my brother minus the tattoos and piercings. I wear red and gold usually and the only piercings I have are my earrings.
2:48:And you're one of those people who wear all neon and blind innocent victims,aren't you?
2:49:Is this the brother who doesn't smash heads or does voodoo but has an implied dark past? My school has a green uniform that isn't neon. I have blinded no one.
2:50:No,my other brother. And somehow I doubt that...
2:51:I can't believe you don't trust me. We've been talking for about an hour!
2:52:I hope that was sarcasm. Didn't anyone teach you about cyber safety?
2:53:? My foster mother/thing and my chemistry teacher got me this thing as a joint gift and just told me not to become a zombie like the other teens these days. 
2:54:YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT CYBER SAFETY? At least I know you're not a 30 year old man stalker. And we are not zombies,thank you very much.
2:57:I'm fourteen,so quite far from being a middle aged man. You are all zombies admit it. SSS just told me about cyber safety and I'm not sure I want this... thing anymore.
2:58:SSS? Do her parents hate her or do you? And I'm fourteen too and believe me,phones are amazing.
2:59:Expected words from one of the teenage zombies. THIS IS A BLACK BOX OF STALKERS. SSS are her initials and she hates it,so naturally it's her nickname.
3:00 I see. Do you have a nickname?
3:01:Nothing that I'll tell you.
3:02:I'LL GUESS THEN.
3:02:Let's see... loves ugly colors,hates phones,wears green...
3:03:Hey!
3:05:I've got nothing *pouts* For safety reasons,I won't tell you my real name,but they call me Queenie.
3:03:TYEUV256I^B
3:04:?
3:05:A butterfly just landed ON MY NOSE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL GOOD LORD.
3:05:In school? In military school? DON'T TOUCH THE WINGS WHATEVR YOU DO.
3:06:Don't worry. I'm good with butterflies,I know this stuff.
3:07:Cool. Does your name have anything to do with them? *wink wink*
3:09:o_o
3:07 I'M CLOSE YESSS I'M AMAZING. Also,I'm pleasantly surprised you know what emojis are,butterfly boy.
3:08:409 woke up rather disoriented and snatched mine and SSS's phones and downloaded some random apps. One of them was emojis. How'd you know I'm a boy? And no,not my nickname. Stop guessing.
3:09:I just guessed but I'm a girl if it makes you feel better. I'm not giving up Caterpillar Boy.
3:10:HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NICKNAME YOU STALKER?
3:11:OMG IS THAT YOUR ACTUAL NICKNAME? PEOPLE CALL YOU THAT?
3:11:LOL IN A CORNER DYING.
3:12:Yes. Go ahead and die.
3:13:Meanie. So you nearly killed 409 and he got you new apps?
3:14:Yeah,but he looked disoriented. Or he booby trapped them.
3:15:It would serve you right but that is sadly impossible. So,you're clueless about this stuff. But you go to school.
3:16:Military school full of prats and lots of exploding. The gate is exploding as we speak.
3:16:I think someone just died.
3:17:...
3:17:No wait that was just my chemistry teacher.
3:18 He died!?
3:19:No he was just exploding stuff it's his hobby. He can't die.
3:19:Can't or doesn't think he will?
3:20:Can't. He's somehow indestructible,believe me. 
3:21:That's impossible. Believe me,my mum works at the hospital and my brother wants to go into med school. 
3:22:The head smashing/voodoo making brother? He sounds like a bit of a hazard for hospitals. No really my chemistry teacher sat on a grill once by accident and nothing happened.
3:22:Another time a shark bit him and he just casually shook it off.
3:23:And once he ate a daisy.
3:23:He sounded cool up until the daisy thing.
3:23:Daises are poisonous.
3:24:Oh. Is he real? He should be in Ripley's Believe it or Not.
3:25:I went there once! It was great until my foster mother/thing started pointing out all the hidden strings and stuff and tried to get our money back.
3:26:Aw,that sucks. 
3:28:# $%&K^Vbusfubwdvs
3:30:Sorry SSS just tried to grab my phone.
3:31:My friend Wolf Boy is texting me. He wants me to go to some tree protest thing. -_-
3:31:Sounds like 409. He made me dress up as a wolverine once and dance around some skinny bush the school wanted to cut down. 
3:32:I should go now,stranger with violent tendencies. Ttyl.
3:33:All right then,bye stranger who helped me with violent tendencies and has shady brothers.
3:34:THERE WAS NO HELPING.
5:17:I'M FAILING!
5:19:Your life in a nutshell,Jo-Jo.
5:20:RUDE! Med is hard!
5:21:Chill,you've been doing this since you were 5. You'll do fine.
5:21:Thanks,Jen. That was surprisingly nice of you.
5:22:Also,I think the mafia's after Marissa.
5:22:WHAT?
5:23:Remember that cult she used to be part of? Anway,who were you texting earlier?
5:24 WHAT?
5:25:Jen?
5:25:YOU CAN'T TELL THESE THINGS SO CASUALLY!
5:26:What was I supposed to use capslock? Who were you texting?
5:27:Some wrong number,nothing to worry about. You,on the other hand...
5:27:Marissa is weird.
5:28:And creepy
5:29:Jo-Jo,she's your girlfriend.
5:29:True true. I love my Marissa.
5:30:You disgust me. And I need to go now.
5:31:Okay,but if it was a wrong number,why did you keep texting?
5:32:It was a funny wrong number. Honestly,it's fine.
5:33:30 YEAR OLD STALKER
5:33:No,14 year old wrong number.
5:34:WHAT HAVE WE TAUGHT YOU? HE COULD BE LYING! ABORT! ABORT! ABORT!
5:35:Jo-Jo,he's a teenager!
5:36:STALKER!
5:37:I'M LEAVING.
5:37:DON'T YOU DARE.
5:37:ByE!
7:31:DRAMA QUEEN YOU BETTER START RUNNING!
7:33:Wrong number again. What did she do?
7:34:Oh,it's you. 409 decided to get revenge on me and Drama Queen helped.
7:35:What happened?
7:36:We shall not speak of it. Ever. And now my pudding fell on the floor.
7:36:Aww,poor you. So what are you doing right now?
7:37:I'm aggressively eating a lemon,which is actually rather painful.
7:37:I had no idea my lips had so many cuts.
7:38:How does that work? Also,aren't you chasing Drama Queen and 409?
7:39:I was ripping through it as though it was Drama Queen and 409. But I calmed down. And I decided to get them back after school tomorrow instead,when they're not expecting it.
7:39:I hate barbie and my little pony now.
7:40:That was a little off topic so it probably had something to do with their revenge? And is eating lemons a common past time for you,because that is rather strange.
7:42:Not usually. I just gave the rest to my lizard.
7:43:Sweet,a lizard? What's it's name?
7:43:My brother just kicked me into the ocean omg
7:44:How are you still texting?! His name is Spit Fyre.
7:45:My phone's waterproof. And my brother is now unapologetically surfing away.
7:46:I'm going to ignore my confusion at that and ask something else. The smashing/voodoo brother or the one in black? Also,surfing? Where are you?
7:47:He's a different one,and don't have any voodoo brothers. That one is at home with his fiance. And California. You?
7:47:Nevada. Do you have an army of morally dubious brothers or something?
7:48:I've got 6 brothers if that's what you mean. Not an army,thank goodness.
7:50:HOW ARE YOU ALIVE.
7:50:THAT'S SO MANY.
7:51:I ask myself this a lot tbh. And now my emo brother is trying to get me to swim with him.
7:52:I kicked him and now he's rolling down the sand dune.
7:53:HEARTLESS. SSS is trying to get me to the same with Beetle.
7:54:Hey,you're the voodoo wannabe,not me. btw,you have pretty strange nicknames. I don't understand them. Do you actually use them or is this just for safety?
7:55:We use them sometimes,but not usually. Beetle's his real name,though.
7:56:I know a naaaaame. I just need to stalk people who know someone named Beetle and then I'll find you.
7:57:Do his parents hate him or?
7:58:Ha you wish and it's a long story. My Chemistry teacher's calling me now.
7:58:The one that can't die?
7:59:The very same. Drama Queen is visiting her fiance and 409 is lord knows where so I better go.
8:00:Bye Caterpillar Boy.
8:02:Don't call me that. Bye Queenie. Have fun with your morally dubious brothers.
8:03:HEY!
8:03:DENIAAAAL! Bye!
8:04:You sound like my surfing brother. Jeez,I'm glad you're not one of them. Bye!
A/N:It's an abrupt ending,I know. I typed this up real fast this morning,so it's not the best quality. Reviews would be appreciated,though. (and someone write something on this site...)

A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. I was bored,so instead of finishing In Charge like I should be (writer's block STILL) I decided to add a chapter to my not anymore oneshot! I know,makes total sense. The reviewer for the last chapter (thanks by the way!) asked if I could do this with other characters,so I decided to just expand this with more texting peeps.
My Mordern AU universe is a bit weird so bear with me. It's a bit obvious Marcellus would be the Chemistry teacher,but I had trouble with everyone else. But basically Sep goes to a prissy military school with his friends (Syrah,Lucy (gonna address why she's still in high school later) Beetle,and 409) where Marcia is the principal and Jenna goes to public school with her friends (Bo and Snorri) and her brothers (Nicko and Jo-Jo,who are the only ones still in high school). I honesty don't know how I chose THAT gang for Septimus's friends,but whatever.
Also,idk if I ship Septyrah but it just up and kinda happened. I might do some Jeetle.
Sorry for all the Harry Potter stuff. I just imagine them both to be extreme Potterheads.

5:17:Good morning,murderer-wannabe.
5:20:NO.
5:21:I'm going to guess you don't like being woken up early?
7:09:You think,Sherlock?
7:10:What possessed you text me at the IDIOTIC TIME OF 5 IN THE MORNING?!
7:10:Why were you even awake? I wasn't,and I go to military school where they wake us up at stupid o' clock.
7:15:Hey,some people actually wake up at 5 and would find this insulting.
7:16:My brother woke us up by breaking the coffee pot and I couldn't go back to sleep.
7:16:Because I was bored
7:18:You know what I do when I'm bored at 5? I SLEEP.
7:20:This was a one time thing and it was my brother's fault. On weekends I usually sleep till 2 so I'm not really a morning person.
7:22:You 2 pm sleepers are real? I thought that was a myth. 
7:24:That's crazy we're not myths we're normal. What,don't you sleep in on weekends? 
7:25:You ARE a myth and I am telling SSS.
7:25:The latest I've slept in is ten. My foster mother thing makes me get up on weekends to clean the library.
7:26:Jeez.
7:28:Now I'm tired and it's your fault.
7:28:Okay,okay,I won't text till seven.
7:29:You plan on texting me more?
7:31:Eh,you're fun to argue with.
7:32:Same.
7:33:I'd better go,Drama Queen is annoyed at me for being late.
7:33:She drives you?
7:34:Me and SSS. She has her own car and stuff. 409 likes the bus because he can scare people on it by pretending to be a wolverine.
7:35:I'm getting more and more convinced he and Wolf Boy should meet.
7:36:That sounds dangerous.
7:37:I just realized something.
7:39:That you need medical attention ASAP?
7:40:Rude. I was thinking of who you really reminded me of last night because of the way you talk and it's my oldest brother.
7:40:Have I heard of him yet?
7:41:He's the one you thought does voodoo and went to jail even though he did neither.
7:43:I'm not sure if I should be offended or flattered.
7:43:Didn't you already tell me this?
7:44:You remind me of all my brothers. Just my oldest one the most.
7:45:I don't want to go to jail:(
7:45:HE DIDN'T GO TO JAIL.
7:46:And if you keep hitting people with calculators then you're halfway there already.
7:49:I looked up the sentence for hitting people with school supplies and there is nothing. Ha.
7:50:Your search history must look weird. I have to go,I'll text you later.
8:08:VOODOO ISN'T ILLEGAL YOU LIAR!
8:09:AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
8:10:HA!
8:15:Hey,my brother told me it was I didn't know better.
8:16:You know,I'm really worried right now for that 409 person.
8:20:Don't worry he's actually my best friend forever.
8:21:Of course...
11:03:I HATE HISTORY!
11:04:IT'S SO BORING GOOD LORD.
11:06:History is important. If you don't study history you'll repeat the mistakes of the dudes before us.
11:08:Ugh.
11:09:So much for my speech. 409 was just complaining about history a moment ago.
11:10:A fellow hater? What did this kind soul say?
11:10:He says that history in a nutshell is that white people bring doom with them.
11:12:True true. That is surprisingly accurate.
11:14:What do you have?
11:16:English is starting soon. I'm on break.
11:17:I like English. Way better than history.
11:18:Everyone dies in English.
11:20:I'm concerned about the school you go to.
11:22:We're reading Shakespeare WHERE EVERYONE JUST UP AND DIES. No one actually died in class.
11:22:Yet.
11:23:Please tell me you're not planning something. Now I have class to go to so ttyl.
11:24:No,but 409 is in that class and he brings chaos with him. Bye.
12:22:OMG
12:23:O MY GOURD
12:24:OH MY FREAKING GOURD
12:24:What? What is it?!
12:27:MY CHEM TEACHER CAME INTO ENGLISH CLASS AND THE DOOR FELL OFF THE HINGES AND ON HIS FACE AND CRUSHED HIM
12:28:THEN WE THOUGHT HE DIED AND THEN HE JUST POPPED UP WITHOUT EVEN A SCRATCH AND JUST
12:28:Woah. 
12:29:That sounds scary! I'm glad he's okay.
12:30:Yeah me too but I'm pretty shaken.
12:31:It was a heavy door and they're sending him to the doctor in case even though nothing happened to him.
12:32:Do you have chem class today?
12:32:Yeah there's gonna be a substitute. I'll text you later.
12:33:Same. I hope your teacher stays okay. Bye.
12:34:Looking back actually I overreacted because he can't die so he's completely fine but thanks. Bye.
12:37:Hey Sep,who were you texting? Did you get a girlfriend?
12:38:Beetle,that's your default question for every girl I meet. Honestly,I'm starting to miss that phase you went through when you tried to set me up with Syrah.
12:39:That wasn't a phase! You guys are going out to a romantic dinner tomorrow!
12:40:No. Why.
12:42:Lucy and I already got reservations and everything. I used my allowance.
12:42:Can I borrow five bucks?
12:43:...
12:43:Ask me again in person.
12:44:So,about the texting.
12:45:For all you know,it was 409 I was texting.
12:46:409 accidentally smashed his phone with a hammer yesterday. Please tell me? I'll give you Fizzfroot...
12:46:You're crazy you'd end up giving me some anyway. Not my girlfriend,just a wrong number.
12:47:Wrong number? Sep,how old is this guy? How do we know it's not a creep who sits on the couch all day eating potatoes?
12:48:Isn't that what your cousin Barry does?
12:49:Besides the point.
12:50:She's fourteen like me and I can take care of myself.
12:51:Should I tell Lucy?
12:51:DON'T! You know how she gets now that she decided we're pseudo siblings.
12:53:Okay. BUT be careful and no address or photos or real names!
12:54:I know all this,jeez.
12:55:How was your test?
12:56:You know what I think I aced it! GOOD BYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE STUPID CLASS!
12:57:You have another class in thirty minutes.
12:58:You ray of sunshine,you.
12:58:Why are we literally standing back to back and texting each other.
12:59:Two words:The Muggles.
1:00:I should really get around to reading that series,huh?
1:02:DUDE! YOU DIDN'T START IT?
1:03:I WATCHED AVATAR WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO!
1:05:I'm number 52 on the wait list so no I didn't.
1:05:And I had to literally drag you kicking and screaming and duct tape you to the chair to watch Avatar.
1:06:Unimportant. Avatar is amazing.
1:07:Which is what I told you for two years before you watched it.
1:08:Eh,potayto potahto.
1:09:Now you sound like cousin Barry.
1:09:Not cousin Barry! Oh,the horror!
2:31:How was chemistry class?
2:34:They actually canceled it because the substitute was out of town teaching something else.
2:35:So no class which kinda sucks since chem is my favorite:(
2:36:Less homework for you,though! My phone broke earlier.
2:37:What?! How are you still texting?
2:38:Eh,my friend had a spare phone and transferred my card thingy to it.
2:38:I'll hereon forth refer to her as Weasley.
2:39:What was she doing with a spare phone? Also,red hair?
2:40:Red hair. She's a strange human. I stopped asking ten years ago.
2:41:WAIT. YOU'RE A POTTERHEAD?!
2:42:Yep. You too?
2:43:HECK YEAH. So what's up with you?
2:44:Beetle is trying to set me up with SSS and bought a reservation for a romantic dinner or some nonsense. I'm honestly scared.
2:45:Ha ha. Is she your girlfriend?
2:45:I'm only fourteen so no. Maybe later. But Beetle's already planning our wedding and wants to be the man of honor.
2:46:That's not a thing. Why not best man?
2:47:He has something against best mans.
2:47:Best men?
2:47:I think men?
2:48:So what are you doing?
2:49:Hanging out with Weasley and Salt Face. They're eating some snacks they got from no one knows where.
2:50:They have Oreos!
2:51:NO FAIR!
2:52:HA!
2:52:Wait these are Walmart Oreo wannabes. THEY TRICKED ME!
2:54:Ugh I hate those wannabe products. All the names are so lame.
2:55:Hey,I rhymed!
2:55:That was a sucky rhyme.
2:55:Now Salt Face and Weasley are giving me looks because I'm laughing so hard that I choked on a wannabe cookie.
2:56:Salt Face is doing some total judgingr3w58ftbsvdtjzszdhaskj
2:57:HEY PERSON JENNA IS TEXTING! ARE YOU A THIRTY YEAR OLD CREEP?
2:57:Hi Salt Face or Weasley. No I am not a creep and I'm only fourteen.
2:58:WEASLEY! LIKE GINNY BUT COOLER CAUSE GINNY SUCKED!
2:59:I actually liked Ginny but her development on page started too late and can you give Jenna back her phone.
3:00:GINNY SUCKED! I LIKE HER AND HARRY BUT SHE WASN'T WRITTEN GOOD.
3:01:Eh,to each their own. Ginny's character makes more sense when you think about where she's coming from.
3:02:...I'LL DO A REREAD.
3:02:That's nice. Now,return the phone?
3:03:OVER MY DEAD #E4387
3:04:I'm so sorry about that! This is Queenie again.
3:04:Salt Face and Weasley are rolling down a hill and laughing now. I hope they crash into a rock.
3:05:It's okay,Jenna.
3:06:WHAT.
3:06:NO NO NO I'VE BEEN EXPOSED MY IDENTITY HAS BEEN REVEALED.
3:06:THE END IS NIGH!
3:07:This is a little dramatic. Are you a superhero or something? 
3:07:My name is Septimus if that makes you feel better.
3:12:Jenna? Are you okay?
3:13:Nothing,I'm fine. You have a weird name.
3:14:How rude! Coming from a girl who calls her friend Salt Face.
3:15:What's the story behind that?
3:17:She'd an exchange student from Norway and she came this summer on a boat and she was such a good sailor that the captain actually let her be at the wheel for a bit. She sails A LOT.
3:17:And then a few months ago we dared her to drink salt water and she did so- Salt Face. What about Drama Queen?
3:18:Cool. Drama Queen just screams a lot and exaggerates everything.
3:18:Hmm,sounds like she'd make a good actor.
3:20:I've told her that,but she's too into architecture to consider anything else. Hey,why aren't you in class?
3:21:I have a study. You?
3:22:I'm in the principle's office.
3:22:WHAT?! And you're texting?
3:23:Calm down,my foster mother thing is the principle,she calls me here whenever she wants to talk to me.
3:24:She's not here at the moment. I am shaking in fear.
3:25:Really?
3:25:No,not really. But she can be pretty intimidating.
3:26:Okay,I can hear her tapping down the hallway. Got to go.
3:27:Don't do anything crazy.
3:28::D
3:32:What the cucumber,Bo? Why'd you steal my phone?
3:33:SO I COULD SEE WHO YOU WERE TEXTING ALSO HOW DO YOU TURN OFF CAPSLOCK?
3:33:You press the button again. And don't steal my phone again. I was going to tell you myself.
3:34:Thanks,Jen. I just sped up the process so no harm done!
3:35:Sigh.
3:35:Oh wait I just remembered!
3:36:That your essay is due tomorrow and you didn't start it yet?
3:36:No I knew that. We're gonna meet Si's fiance today! You know,properly.
3:39:REALLY? Take pictures!
3:40:Of course!
4:02:I'm in trooouuuuble.
4:03:I think it was ineeeevvviiitaaable.
4:04:What did you do?
4:04:I ditched biology to hang out with my Chemistry teacher yesterday.
4:05:Ha ha teacher's pet.
4:06:Oh,be quiet. Anyway,she doesn't like the teacher and the teacher doesn't like her and ditching is bad so I have a warning. But no detention,thank God.
4:07:Do you get any special treatment since you're the principal's foster son?
4:08:No,not really. If anything,she's harder on me because she wants me to do my best.
4:10:That sounds a little harsh.
4:12:Nah,she's cool.
4:12:You mention being a foster kid a lot. Did anything happen to your parents?
4:16:Sorry,that was inconsiderate of me. I shouldn't have asked.
4:19:It's fine. I don't know what happened to my family. I was kidnapped when I was a baby and taken into this group that literally wanted to overthrow the president and take over the US. I don't even know my last name.
4:20:I'm sorry. My mom died an hour after I was born and I didn't know I was adopted till I was ten. My real dad just found out I'm alive two years ago but he doesn't really know how to act with me.
4:22:I'm sorry.
4:23:Eh,that's life,right?
4:24:True. I'm just lucky my foster mother found me.
4:24:I'm glad. How old were you?
4:25:Eleven. Before that I had another foster mother who was like a grandma and lived in a cottage in the middle of nowhere. I had a goth/punk kid for a foster brother. We fought over names.
4:26:Interesting. I know a lot of punk kids,one of my brothers works at a hot topic wannabe store.
4:26:The jail one,the surfer one,or the emo one?
4:27:HE DIDN'T GO TO JAIL GOSH. The emo one.
4:28:Potayto potahto. So your family had six kids and adopted you too? That's really lucky. 
4:30:Right? That's why I was so shocked when I found out. Idk why now looking back because I look nothing like them. I mean even my parents look the same.
4:31:I am so confused about families with similar looking parents. How does that happen?
4:31:No idea. I used to wonder if Mum dyed her hair or something.
4:32:My foster mother and I have super similar eyes. It's freaky. And kind of cool.
4:33:You sound like you get a long really well. That sounds nice.
4:34:We do. She's the best except when she tries to take me shoe shopping. I honestly don't know how my life just flipped from that illegal army to this.
4:34:Anyway I have homework now. You?
4:36:Piano lessons from my brothers who are twins and have no idea how to play.
4:37:Why are they giving you lessons then?
4:38:I HAVE NO IDEA. I've given up on understanding them.
4:39:Sounds wise. I have to go.
5:08:Hey,Septimus? 
5:09:Yeah? You can call me Sep,you know.
5:10:Then you call me Jen. Thanks for telling me about your family.
5:12:You're welcome. You told me too. So,thanks for listening,Jen.
5:13:No problem. You too.
7:30:Hey Sep,can I come over? I've got movies.
7:32:Duh. I was just making popcorn. Also,don't use the doorbell. It's making duck sounds.
7:36:Okay,almost there. I have Wreck it Ralph,Mulan,How to Train Your Dragon,and Toy Story 2. Which one should we watch?
7:37:HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON!
7:38:Why do I even ask? Can 409,Beetle,and Luce come?
7:38:HICCCCUUUUPPPPPP!
7:39:Yeah sure. You text them,Syrah.
7:39:Wait,409 said he's in California earlier.
7:40:On it. 
7:40:Wait,what? How?
7:40:Idk.
7:41:Hey,isn't it a school night?
7:42:Hey,wasn't this your idea?
7:43:Hey,weren't you making popcorn anyway?
7:43:Hey,for all you know that could've been my dinner.
7:44:Who eats popcorn for dinner?
7:45:Me:(
7:46:No comment.
7:48:Have you ever eaten popcorn for dinner?
7:50:What? No who does that?
7:51:Me
7:52:Why?
7:53:Why not?
7:53:It's not dinner food,dummy.
7:54:YOU'RE FOODIST.
7:55:Good grief.
A/N:Way longer than I expected. This might be moving too fast,but I wanted their names out quick. And yes,that cottage is Aunt Zelda's and the kid is Merrin. I think he'll make a cameo. Anyway,review please.

A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. Enjoy this terrible chapter. For the record I don't watch my little pony,my lil sister does. Way too much.
I was basing the military school off one my cousin went to in another country,but I realize now that would be really innacurate so I'm gonna go back and change that later to something else. Idk what.
Okay,one thing I forgot to mention sorry. Jenna,Nicko,and Jo-Jo don't remember Septimus because they were babies when he was born,right? But,unlike in the book,here Sarah,Silas,and the older brothers never talk about him. So those three never knew there was another brother. This is important to the plot. (I can't believe I'm writing something with a plot:P)
Bold- Septimus;Italics- Jenna;Underline- Lucy;Underline italics- first Merrin then Bo;Normal- Beetle;Underline bold- Wolf Boy.
5:58:Septimus,help me escape Syarh! I get one tiny burn from the popcorn maker last night and now she's MOTHERING ME! Like,I'm three years older than her!
5:59:Ugh,two early wake up calls two days in a row. Go back to sleep and Syrah'll get bored.
5:59:I can't sleep with her hovering over me! Who woke you up yesterday? 
6:00:Was it 409 calling to tell you that pandas are going extinct and it's our fault?
6:01:I swear he's getting weirder. I've never even seen China. And no,it was someone else.
6:02:You know,you're being awfully vague. *raises eyebrows*
6:03:It's just some girl I know,Drama Queen.
6:05:Okay,first off,that name is stupid. It's Lucy. Secondly,who is she? Do we know her?
6:06:I smell burnt lizard! Is Spit Fyre near the oven again?
6:07:How do you know how burnt lizard smells?
6:08:Did I ever tell you how Spit Fyre got his name? Well,my young apprentice,here is the tale of Spit Fyre...
6:09:No. I'm older than you. Stop changing the subject. 
6:10:It's a really good story!
6:11:Septimuuuuuus
6:13:Fine,I texted a wrong number the other day and we're still talking. DON'T FREAK!
6:15:DON'T FREAK? WE DON'T KNOW HER! SHE COULD BE A THIRTY YEAR OLD CREEP!
6:15:Why is it always thirty year old? Like,can't forty year olds be creeps too?
6:16:And I'M the one who texted her. She's fourteen and I've told her barely anything. Nothing she can use.
6:16:STOP TEXTING HER!
6:16:Syrah agrees!
6:17:Wait,you told Syrah? That's it,I'm going to sleep for another hour. Only text when you're calm again.
6:20:SEPTIMUS!
6:22:DO I NEED TO GO UP THERE?
6:25:WAKE UP! DON'T BE STUPID! WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE WORRIED.
6:30:You know what,I'm coming up there.
6:31:Just be glad we didn't tell Marcia.
7:22:I'M GOING TO KILL DRAMA QUEEN! She lectured me for so long that she lost her voice HA HA.
7:25:Wow,that must have been some talk. Why was she lecturing you? 
7:25:Since about six thirty I've been up being lectured by Drama Queen and SSS about texting possible creepy stalker.
7:26:You've been cheating on me with another creepy stalker?:(
7:28:Nah,they were talking about you. They don't like that I don't know you.
7:28:Actually,that THEY don't know you so they can stalk and interrogate you.
7:30:That's interesting. When I told Weasley and Salt Face and Wolf Boy they just asked for your number so they could text you for blackmail.
7:31:Just be glad they aren't as crazy overprotective as mine. What about your brothers?
7:33:Only the emo one knows,but he forgot about it by the time we saw each other in person at dinner. He was pretty protective about it,tho.
7:33:You know,when I think of your friends,I think of a motorcycle gang.
7:34:I wish. Let's see... Beetle's the student body president,SSS is captain of the swim team,409 is head of the survival club (along with me),and Drama Queen's also on the student counsel.
7:37:Woah talk about unexpected. We should totally exchange friends. But I gotta go now.
7:39:Yeah same. Tell about your friends when you're back?
7:40:Will do!
10:06:Sup Jenna.
10:10:Hi. How many real roots does f (x) = 4x^2 - 8x - 16 have? 
10:11:What?
10:12:The answer is two.
10:13:Ooh thanks. I'm in an algebra test right now. 
10:13:Oh sorry. I'll text you later.
10:15:Nope,it's fine. I just finished the last question. So,why are you texting me?
10:17:I'm waiting for my foster mother in the principle's office and got bored.
10:18:YOU'RE IN THE PRINCIPLE'S OFFICE AGAIN?
10:20:DUDE! 
10:22:I'm deeeeaaaad. At my funeral I want a cake with a dragon on it,okay? And a green coffin. The cake will be chocolate.
10:23:Chocolate?
10:23:CAN I COME? 
10:25:I'm terribly offended right now.:(
10:25:And it's a four hour drive from CA to NV so no.
10:27:Do people even eat cake at funerals? Also why'd you hire me to plan the funeral when I'm not invited?
10:28:I didn't hire you to plan it.
10:29:Scroll up. Anyway,why are you in the office?
10:30:I might've skipped bio for chem again?
10:32:Do my ears deceive me or did you make the same stupid mistake TWO DAYS IN A ROW?
10:33:Your ears didn't deceive you,dummy. You're reading this.
10:34:True true. But still! Do you like chemistry that much?
10:36:He's sorta teaching me alchemy.
10:37:I'm not very sciencey but- isn't chemistry alchemy improved?
10:38:Yeah pretty much. But we're blowing up stuff and recording how it blew up too,and he calls that alchemy. Plus he's trying to make gold out of... pretty much everything.
10:40:I wanna meet him.
10:41:No. MY chemistry teacher.
10:42:Who you share with a whole class.
10:43:Point. BUT EVERYONE IS THAT CLASS IS SO TALL AND THEY BLOCK THE BOARD AND I HAVE TO SIT ON A BOOK TO SEE AND IT SUCKS!
10:45:Woah,woah. Are you okay? I used to be the shortest in class in middle school,and it really sucked.
10:47:Okay,that was weirdly aggressive sorry about that. A tall person just came by and kicked me on the way to the office,so I was still grumpy. Just,it's annoying to be the youngest in class sometimes.
10:49:It's okay. And they're probably only older by a couple of months,so you can't be that much younger.
10:51:Two years,actually.
10:53:What? How?
10:54:It's nothing.
10:56:You can tell me.
10:56:If you want:)
10:58:I actually skipped ninth and tenth grade,but I don't really like talking about it.
10:58:It feels like bragging,you know?
11:01:Oh wow. That's cool that you're so smart. And yeah I get it.
11:02:My dad,the real one,really wants to get to know me so he spoils me with all this expensive stuff. He doesn't get that I don't like going out in a limo.
11:02:It's not the same thing,but it feels like bragging even though I feel bad about it.
11:03:Woah,you turned down a limo? He sounds nice. I kind of feel worse about it because one of my friends had to repeat a grade. Technically two grades,but one of them wasn't her fault.
11:04:Well school doesn't actually define how smart you are,anyway.
11:05:Yeah,she's super street smart.
11:05:Gotta go,I can her my foster mother coming.
11:06:Bye. Ttyl. Thanks for listening and stuff again.
11:07:Same. Bye!
11:32:I'M ALIVE!
11:36:DIE!
11:37:But 409,it's me,Septimus,your best friend since kindergarten! I'm sorry I hit you with the calculator the other day. Anyway I'm back from the office.
11:39:I'M Septimus and NOT 409.
11:40:What?
11:43:Merrin?!
11:45:IT'S SEPTIMUS! WRONG NUMBER,LOSER!
12:00:Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetle.
12:02:That is NOT my name.
12:03:Beeeeeeeeeeeeeetle?
12:04:...
12:05:You know who I accidentally texted? 
12:06:The potential thirty year old stalker with a fondness for potatoes? You told me that yesterday.
12:07:You made up the potato part. Honestly,Beet,you spend too much time with your cousin Barry.
12:07:I see him like,twice a year.
12:08:Even once a year is too much. And anyway,no,not her.
12:10:Alright then,who?
12:13:MERRIN MEREDITH!
12:14:DANIEL HUNTER?!
12:16:NO.
12:16:Gosh can't you read? I PUT IT IN ALL CAPS AND EVERYTHING.
12:17:What part of Merrin Meredith looks like Daniel Hunter?
12:20:Sep,Merrin IS Daniel.
12:22:Say what?
12:23:Remember when he tried to get hired at Starbucks? He said his name was Septimus and then Daniel Hunter.
12:23:Oh right! I forgot!
12:24:You didn't even know in the first place.
12:25:Tomayto tomahto.
12:27:Wait! I thought we were potato buddies!
12:29:HA!
12:29:We're POTTER buddies now! *snaps fingers dramatically*
12:30:You don't know how weird that looks.
12:31:WAIT! How'd you know I got the book this morning?
12:32:LOOK! IS THAT PRINCESS CELESTIA?
12:33:YOU WATCH MY LITTLE PONY? GET OUT!
12:34:NO LUCY DOES! Do YOU watch it?
12:35:No same as you. Everything I know from it I know from Lucy. And Partridge.
12:35:Ahh,Partridge. How is the boy?
12:36:Dude,he's older than you. And I can totally see you stroking a fake beard right now.
12:37:You know me too well,my friend.
12:39:Okay stop with the old man voice and CHANGING THE SUBJECT! How'd you know?
12:40:Well.
12:42:You snooped!
12:43:It was peeking out! And it's not like I read your journal or anything.
12:44:Sorry about that.
12:45:It's okay it's just a library book. What did Merrin say?
12:46:Said his name was Septimus. You know,the usual,like always.
12:48:True. I heard he's in CA. Anyway,I'm going to read the first HP book tonight so NO SPOILERS!
12:50:California? Really? And you spoiled Avatar for me!
12:51:It was barely a spoiler! He lives there with his mom.
12:52:It was a total spoiler. I think Marcia told me that,actually. She might've helped him find her? Anyway,class time!
12:54:Woah,that's weird. I can drive us home after school.
12:55:Yes PLEASE!
2:16:Hey Jen you said you'd tell me about the fiance!
2:18:Oh my cheeseball Bo,Simon actually hadn't even asked her when he told us.
2:19:And?
2:19:AND SHE WAS HANGING OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CALLED!
2:20:SO SHE DIDN'T COME?
2:21:EXACTLY!
2:22:Lucy's not really my first choice for a sister,and we kinda got off to a bad start,but she's nice and I wanted to have that family dinner,you know?
2:23:I get you,sister. Do you know why she didn't like,leave early or something?
2:25:Si didn't actually ask her to come,just what she was doing. It was a sleepover.
2:26:Oh well. I'm sorry,Jen. But there's next time. And remember- pictures!
2:27:Yeah,I guess so. Thanks.
2:27:I'll remember!
2:28:You better. Now Snorri said that she and Nicko are going sailing later? She said we could come.
2:30:Do we really want to be in a boat with those two making heart eyes at each other?
2:31:Yes,we do.
2:32:Free food?
2:32:Free food. Snorri's soup is soooo gooood.
4:46:Hey,I never heard back on you about the office thing.
4:50:If you died,it was your fault.
4:52:Did you die?
4:58:Oh my God you're actually dead.
5:00:Uh,so,bye. Rest in peace?
5:16:Sorry I was studying so my phone was off! I love how you just decided I was dead and left.
5:19:Ohhh whoops. Well,in my defense you seemed pretty certain that would be the outcome when you told about the situation a couple of hours ago.
5:22:You ARE alive,right?
5:23:Sorry,I was just staring at my phone in shock because you actually kind of sounded literate back there.
5:24:RUDE! You have no right to criticize people when you hit a poor boy with a calculator like,two days ago.
5:24:But he forgave me! Also he was not a 'poor boy'.
5:25:Uh huh...
5:26:You know,two of my brothers are training to be police men,so maybe I might meet you in the future someday.
5:27:I'm not going to jail! The emo one,the surfer one,the voodoo one,or the twins? 
5:28:GOOD GRIEF,NONE OF MY BROTHERS DID VOODOO! The twins. I have one more,just so you know.
5:30:You have a twin?!
5:31:No,another brother! He's the second oldest and he camps and hikes a lot and he makes maps.
5:32:I'm going to call him the map one.
5:32:You do that.
5:34:Hey,you never told me about your friends.
5:35:Oh,right! Well,they're just idiots who spend all class talking back to the teachers under their breath in Norwegian and doodling on the notes (Salt Face) or painting their nails random colors and narrating everything everyone does in annoying whisper (Weasley).
5:37:They sound like fun people. I'd get on great with them,I bet. You know,unlike you,who is very strange.
5:38:Hey! I'm perfectly normal. My contact name for you is Murdering Weirdo,just so you know.
5:40:You wish. And ha ha what if someone sees? Yours is color hater.
5:42:Hey! I like color. So,have SSS and Drama Queen calmed down?
5:45:I think so,for now. SSS bought me pretzels though so she's forgiven.
5:46:And Drama Queen?
5:48:She's glaring at my head but stops whenever I turn around.
5:49:Are you studying together? That's cute.
5:50:Yeah,Beetle and Drama Queen and I always do bio,chem,and english together. I help them with bio and chem and they help me with emglish.
5:50:I'm hanging out with Wolf Boy and my emo brother right now. Weasley's eating my food in the kitchen. That reminds me,has anyone died in english yet?
5:52:No one besides Romeo and Juliet,but give it a month.
5:53:YDTvsf23324rwe.
5:54:Wait brb the twins just pushed the piano down the stairs.
5:54:Please try to come back in one piece.
5:59:HELLO WHO IS THIS JENNA IS TEXTING? She slept with a teddy bear until last year and has sixteen nightlights that are all fire hazards. She's afraid of the dark.
6:01:Hi again Weasley or maybe Jenna's brother? Or Wolf Boy? Thank you for the info.
6:02:That's me! Wolf Boy! TURN OFF THE UNNECESSARY LIGHTS IN YOUR HOME AND RECYCLE!
6:02:Ugh you remind me of one of my best friends. Go away.
6:03:HA HA NOPE! Oookaaay,you're a murdering weirdo. Sweet nice to meet you. Have you killed anyone yet or is this just an ambition?
6:05:Well,I'm thinking of killing my honorary sister. And you. Give Queenie back her phone,if she isn't squashed by the piano.
6:07:I see. Very rude. Are you a creepy stalker? ARE YOU A THIRTY YEAR OLD MAN? Can you introduce me to some people who will sponsor me so I won't have to get a job?
6:09:No,no,and I'm in a different state,stupid.
6:10:I go to another state everyday for school and I mostly live there too. I also live here. Are you sure you're not thirty? I'm reading the texts and you sound old.
6:11:WAIT! YOUR NAME IS SEPTIMUS! YOU'RE A WEIRDO,HAS A FOSTER MOTHER PRINCIPLE,A POTTERHEAD,RUDELY HITS THE INNOCENT WITH SCHOOLS SUPPLIES...
6:12:OMG FOURONETWWOOOOO!
6:13:Are you on something?
6:13:The couch. It's a very lumpy couch. And it's FOUROHNIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEE! You are quite rude about me in those texts.
6:14:WHAT? NO WAY!
6:15:Foster kid who lives half in CA half in NV,takes a stupid amount of buses to and from school,very responsible about the environment. 412,I GAVE YOU THE EMOJI APP.
6:17:Holy cow. Well,I know Jenna's really fourteen now at least.
6:20:She didn't tell you? She's actually 38 and got held back so many times that it was embarrassing and had to get plastic surgery as to not look out of place. 
6:21:Tell her to get a new couch.
6:22:That's rude! You do it!
6:27:I'M BACK! The floor's got a huge dent now,and the twins have to pay to fix it. What did Wolf Boy say?
6:28:Scroll up. HE'S 409!
6:31:Holy mushroom.
6:32:So,SSS and Drama Queen can stop panicking. How do you know 409 again?
6:35:Well,his foster mother is our great aunt Zelda,you know,since the year before last year. He sorta lives with us during the school year because our house is closer to the bus but not completely. He became friends with my family really fast,and he hangs out here a lot.
6:36:Oh he's talked about Zelda's family before. This is all so crazy. Do you happen to know any SSSs and Drama Queens and Beetles?
6:37:Nope,but I'll keep my eyes peeled. You do realize I can get all the info I want about you now,right?
6:38:You do realize I know you sleep with night lights,right?
6:38:Oh darn. Ttyl,off to kill Wolf Boy.
6:39:My favorite hobby! I could send you a list of ideas?
6:40:No thanks. I can do without.
6:42:Have fun with the murder.
6:41:Have fun with SSS,Beetle,and Drama Queen.
7:30:Luce,you'll be happy to know I'm texting the possible stalker again.
7:33:No,Septimus I am NOT happy. Don't be stupid. Do we have to give you another talk?
7:34:Actually,you will be. Her friend/great aunt's foster son stole her phone,and it's 409.
7:36:Are you serious? You better not be messing with me,Septimus. Can 409 confirm this?
7:37:I'll calm him later to confirm,but yeah,I'm serious. He's being killed right now for stealing the phone.
7:40:Sorry I got so worried. But you have to admit it could've been bad.
7:41:It's okay,sis.
7:42:*sends heart*
7:42:Anyway,why are we texting in literally the same building? 
7:43:You're at the library too?
7:44:I see you!
7:44:Duh. We just waved at each other.
7:45:Humph. I'm here because if I go home Marcia will make me watch more National Geographic. I am tired of National Geographic.
7:46:Getting some more Shakespeare.
7:46:Bleh. Wanna watch a movie tonight? Maybe Big Hero 6?
7:48:Of course. Will Marcia mind?
7:50:Nah,she likes you. Plus she'll be distracted from National Geographic!
7:51:Whatever you say,Sep.
12:08:WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY IS 409 DOING AT MY DOOR?
12:13:He said he was going to buy buttermilk and blue eggs from the farmer's market. IT'S SO LATE GO TO SLEEP!
12:14:He just showed up here now,and he's got a huge bag. No milk or blue (?) eggs.
12:15:oh no he's staying all weekend.
12:15:Good for you. I need sleep,now go away.
12:16:It's Friday night,who goes to sleep at 12 on Friday?
12:18:Smart people.
12:20:He's eating all the frosted flakes! WHY IS HE HERE?
12:21:My guess is to embarrass us both or something. I'm tired.
12:24:Are you five? Your guess is right. He's telling me stories of you and I'm suddenly feeling like a happy host.
12:25:Good grief. I'm going to sleep now. There had better not be baby pictures.
12:27:He did. Some from this year too. You have purple eyes?!
12:27:Oh no oh no. Burn them! And it's violet not purple.
12:30:Violet IS purple. I have burnt them and let them float into the wind.
1:03:HEY JENNA! GUESS WHAT I HAVE!
1:07:No I'm sleeping scram.
1:08:Liar. You're probably still awake texting 412. Speaking of *inserts photo of twelve year old Septimus in a red beanie*
1:10:OH MY WAFFLE IS THAT SEPTIMUS?
1:11:Yeah that's 412.
1:11:That's so scary! He looks like Jo-Jo and Simon smashed together!
1:13:I like how you phrased that. His hair's underneath the hat. One sec. 
1:15:*Sends photo of a boy holding a lizard and glaring at the camera*
1:17:OMG SPIT FYRE AND SEPTIMUS!
1:17:HE HAS HEAP CURLS. 
1:18:He also has the Heap tendency to not recycle!
1:20:This is a little too weird. I'll go to sleep now.
1:22:Bye Jenna!
2:00:Hey Beetle wanna hear a joke?
2:03:Why are you awake?
2:06:409 invited himself over. We're eating frosted flakes together. So,joke?
2:07:Okay...
2:07:Beetle,what did you say when you hit your head on the box of cereal?
2:08:Ouch?
2:08:BEETs me!
2:09:No.
2:09:That was awful. I'm disowning you as my best friend.
2:10:HAHAHAHAHA HA HAHAHA HA H A HA
2:12:Sep,go to sleep.
A/N:Lol it sucked and I'm tired bye. I'll edit this later. Review please.

A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. I'm so so so sorry for not updating for so long! First the political situation here distracted me,then school. But the past three days I just wrote and wrote this,and it's not the best (the conversations move too fast,I know),but the next update will be better and MUCH soon. And thank you so to everyone who reviewed,your comments make my days,which usually suck. They are very appreciated!

7:01:BO HELP ME! This picture Wolf Boy sent me of Septimus is freaking me out!
7:05:WOAH BACK UP! What's Wolf Boy doing with a photo of your texting buddy?
7:06:Turns out they go to the same school and have been friends since they were two or something. I'll give you the pic. *sends photo of Septimus with his lizard*
7:06:IT'S A SHORT JO-JO WITH A LIZARD! AND COLOR!
7:08:I know right? He looks a lot like him!
7:09:Are his eyes green? He's squinting and I can't zoom.
7:11:Yep. Really green eyes. You can see some curls underneath the hat too.
7:13:Yeah,I see it. What kind of lizard is that? It looks like a dragon.
7:14:It does not! You need new eyes.
7:16:Tilt it to the left.
7:19:No dragon. Dude. But back on topic... what do I do?
7:21:Nothing. There are a lot of look alikes in the world. It happens. Remember when we saw that girl at McDonalds who looked just like me? 
7:22:Do you think he's your long lost cousin or something?
7:23:That would make sense,actually. But Wolf Boy told me Aunt Zelda was his foster mother for a couple of months and she would've known.
7:25:Hmm,true. But she's getting kinda old. You never know.
7:26:Eh,just a look alike probably then. I mean,we have zero cousins. 
7:28:How,though? Didn't your dad have 6 bros?
7:30:Unmarried bros.
7:32:Your family never ceases to amaze me. It's so crazy.
7:33:Our specialty!
7:33:Especially YOU you weirdo dork.
7:35:...I'm adopted.
7:36:I feel like you're only adopted when it's convenient for you:P
7:36:Whatever do you mean,Bo?
7:37:Really though,he might be your cousin. How cool would that be? 
7:37:BUT he probably isn't. Did you know there's an old lady who looks just like harry potter?
7:38:What?
7:39:Google it.
7:41:?!
7:41:Now if you'll excuse me,I'm going to go sleep till noon.
7:45:*Sends voice message of air horn sound*
7:48:JENNA!
11:59:So I heard 409 sent you a picture of me. He's going to PAY.
12:03:Do you want me to get rid of it? Either way you saw me so it's only fair that I saw you too.
12:05:Nah,it's fine. That's a good point but still. Plus you posed and 409 just jumped in front of me with a camera.
12:06:I will accept more photos:D
12:06:No you will not because you are not getting any.
12:07:Mean:( Is your hair curly? And I like 12 year old Sep's hat.
12:09:Yep killing 409. And yeah it's curly. How do you have purple eyes? Colored contacts? Marker? PHOTOSHOP?
12:10:What the heck do you mean by marker?!
12:10:The VIOLET eyes run in my biological mom's family. Idk how it works but I like them.
12:12:But no one can be born with purple eyes! That's impossible!
12:13:Yeah,but I was born with violet eyes.
12:15:It could be a genetic mutation.
12:15:I'm flattered.
12:17:I don't mean that in a bad way. Your eyes are cool. Not as cool as mine,but still cool.
12:18:Hey! Green eyes are lame. Everyone has green eyes.
12:19:Uh,no they don't.
12:19:All my brothers do. Speaking of,you look JUST LIKE one of my brothers.
12:20:The voodoo one? Why do you want me in jail so bad?:( 
12:21:LISTEN UP,NONE OF MY BROTHERS WENT TO JAIL.
12:23:Well,of course you'd SAY that...
12:24:Also I'm 99% sure that we already had this conversation five times.
12:25:BECAUSE YOU WON'T LISTEN. And the emo one.
12:26:The one who works at Hot Topic?
12:26:It's not even hot topic. It's so pathetic,it wants to be hot topic but it's just a weird punkemogoth store thing.
12:28:Haha charming. I'm not emo though. I wear lots of color,unlike some people.
12:28:I wear color!
12:28:Anyway,you look a lot like my brother!
12:30:Wow. You don't say. YAWN.
12:31:Oh my God,you are hopeless. I just thought it was cool.
12:32:I met a girl once who looked just like my friend Romilly. It was scary and I ran away screaming.
12:33:Ran away screaming?!
12:33:That is pathetic. Seriously,she probably thought you were crazy. AND I KNOW ANOTHER NAAAAMEEE.
12:35:Excuse me I managed to look totally awesome while running away. And do you realize you can find out all my friends names while talking to 409?
12:36:That... did not occur to me. Imma get him to bring more pictures!
12:36:DON'T YOU DARE!
12:37:And I bet I can get a lot of pictures of you if I google something like 'California girl with army of endless morally dubious brothers,one of which has been in jail for doing voodoo'.
12:38:*rolls eyes* I'm not even going to comment on the jail thing anymore.
12:38:Acceptance is the first step to redemption!
12:39:God.
12:40:Actually,funny story,someone made a fan blog thing of my family once? We're always all over the place and everyone knows us and someone started a fan blog and kept it going for half a year. They had pictures of us and where we spent the weekend,etc. They took it down after that and we still don't know who it was.
12:42:Didn't it freak you out or anything?
12:43:Nah,we thought it was cool. Although my surfer brother and the twins took it as an opportunity do random stupid things in public and then check back to see if it got posted.
12:45:You thought it was cool that a random stranger was stalking you? I am starting to question this friendship and your family's sanity.
12:47:It sounds bad when you put it that way! We probably did know them though. My family as a whole,we know literally everyone.
12:48:Oooooooh we're friends?
12:50:Taking it back! We are two people who happen to engage in texting over murder.
12:51:We talked about murder,like,once.
12:52:Just kidding. It's fun talking to you. But we totally talked about murder more than once.
12:53:Hey thanks,you too! But we should probably stop with the talking about murder in case the government comes after us. I think they're already tracking my brother's girlfriend.
12:54:What?!
12:55:The voodoo one,right?
12:55:Good grief. Can we call him the chemistry one? He travels around teaching chemistry as his job. Or the money one because the bank loves him. And it's the emo one's gf.
12:56:The bank loves him? I want the bank to love me. How do I get the bank to love me?!
12:57:Idk man. He's just good with money.
12:59:Wait,so your emo brother has a shady girlfriend who is being tracked by the government?
1:00:And apparently the mafia as well.
1:02:Wow. I think I love your family.
1:03:Thanks. We're all lunatics.
1:05:I noticed. I have a confession to make... 409 gave me a picture of ten year old you in a dinosaur suit playing the violin. It made me very confused.
1:07:I THOUGHT I THREW THOSE AWAY!
1:07:HE. IS. SO. DEAD.
1:08:Jenna THE GOVERNMENT!
1:08:oh no.
1:09:GOVERNMENT I MEANT THAT AS A METAPHOR!
1:10:HE's still DEAD THough.
1:11:Metaphorically?
1:12:I hate you.
1:16:Well,you'll love me now because I just pushed 409 down the stairs for you!
1:17:I hope you're joking because Wolf Boy told me you live in a house/mansion-thing with a jillion floors.
1:18:Don't worry,he asked me to. He wanted to surf down the stairs on a mattress he stole off you. 
1:18:...you need a new mattress.
1:19:Yep,definitely dead. I was wondering where it was. I thought my emo brother had taken it!
1:20:Metaphorically dead.
1:20:No,literally.
1:21:But the government!
1:23:My mattress is more important than the government.
1:25:There are many people who would disagree. YOU CAN BUY A NEW MATTRESS.
1:25:NO.
1:26:BUT YOU CAN'T BUY A NEW GOVERNMENT!
1:27:That actually made no sense considering the context. We decided to not talk about murder so the government would not come after us,not so it wouldn't crumble or something:P
1:27::'(
1:28:So does your emo brother steal your mattress a lot?
1:31:Well,he sleeps in a sleeping bag on the floor because he hates making the bed,and uses his actual bed for books. But sometimes he gets annoyed at the floor and steals someone's mattress. We let him because we felt bad when dad sold his real one since he only used it once a month.
1:34:That's pretty interesting. Families are really fascinating.
1:36:I guess a sort of take them for granted.
1:37:You really shouldn't. 409 is now giving himself war paint. He looks like a weird Zuko-wolf hybrid.
1:37:I'll try not to. And please I'd make a way better Zuko then him. Plus I actually have honor,which he lacks by the bucketful.
1:38:You don't really give Zuko vibes to me. And there's only like one person in Avatar who's blond,so I'm no one:(
1:40:Hmm,I can sorta see you becoming the moon.
1:41:Ugh,no. Well,I'd better go. Beetle,Romilly,and the rest of the Dead Languages,Books,and Paper Related Stuff Club are dragging me off to buy expensive pens.
1:42:Nice club name.
1:45:It's horrendous. They need to change it.
2:17:So apparently you kept texting the stranger and he turned out to be Wolf Boy's best friend and he's fourteen. Why didn't you tell me?
2:20:Maybe because you went crazy the first time? And anyway I thought you forgot about it.
2:22:I didn't bring it up again because I thought that you had stopped,and also because someone else would probably find out and then get you in trouble. Besides,if I told you again,you wouldn't have listened.
2:23:But I was right all along!
2:24:Obviously. But I had a good reason to freak out.
2:25:You sound whiny even through the phone.
2:25:Rude! How long has Wolf Boy known him?
2:27:Since they were two. Remember that thing Wolf Boy was part of that wanted to overthrow the government? They met there.
2:28:Jeez.
2:28:Speaking of,how's Marissa?
2:29:What do you mean speaking of? Marissa's doesn't want to overthrow the government! We're going to look at colleges together later.
2:30:Coulda fooled me...
2:30:Also,colleges? How romantic.
2:31:I'm planning on being educated,unlike you.
2:32:I'm educated!
2:34:No proof no witnesses so you are not educated.
2:36:What the heck does that mean you drive me to school like half the time.
2:36:I never actually see you go in. And I'm gonna be late for my shift at work,so I gotta go.
2:37:You literally walk through the doors with me and Nicko oh my God. 
2:37:Ugh,the hot topic wannabe.
2:37:It's called the gothyk grotto. It's beautiful.
2:38:You need glasses.
4:48:So 409 and I are getting blue eggs. Can you recommend some places?
4:50:Are those even a thing? 
4:52:You said he was going to get them yesterday!
4:53:No,HE said he was going to get them. I was just repeating him. Do you want edible blue eggs?
4:53:Well,I'm not going to eat robin eggs. I'm 98% sure that some chickens lay blue eggs.
4:54:Are they blue chickens?
4:56:I'm going to save you some embarrassment by pretending that your text didn't get sent.
4:57:Hey!
4:57:La la LA LA La laaa.
4:59:Hmph. If they ARE real,try the farmer's market or something.
5:00:Good idea,thanks! 
5:01:Hey,have you read Green Eggs and Ham?
5:01:When I was five,yeah.
5:03:I have a theory that the eggs were poisoned- because they were green- and Sam I Am was trying to kill the dog dude.
5:04:What do you do in your free time?
5:04:Also,the ham came from a green pig.
5:06:...That's a good point actually. But stop ruining my childhood.
5:10:HUMPTY DUMPTY WASN'T AN EGG!5:11:Oh MY GOD STop IT.
5:11:STOP.
5:12:STOPPPP ARGHHH.
5:12:AGHWDGN %&^^UWNGS
5:12:I stopped two minutes ago.
5:13:Why would you say that?!
5:14:I just thought it was interesting. And we found the blue eggs!
5:15:They come with a half priced chicken.
5:15:It's terrible! Also is it a real chicken?
5:16:Yep. Should I get it?
5:17:No.
5:19:I got the chicken!
5:20:What. What the heck are you going to do with a chicken? Won't your foster mother mind?
5:21:I will show her that chickens are valued members of society and convert her to chickenism. 
5:24:Chickenism? I'm laughing so hard right now omg. Well,good luck.
5:26:I'm going to name it Beetle 2.0,after my friend Beetle.
5:27:I just choked on my bagel.
6:00:Marica? Can I ask you a hypothetical question?
6:04:Yes,Septimus?
6:06:What would you do if I hypothetically bought a hypothetical white,fluffy,blue egg-laying chicken?
6:06:SEPTIMUS.
6:11:Marcia?
6:12:I don't get paid enough for this.
6:12:It's very fluffy.
6:13:...
6:14:*ScienceApprentice has added BffBeetle,SyrahSalenaSyara,and Otherbff409 to conversation*
6:14:Hello my friends!
6:15:What did you do?
6:15:Did anyone die?
6:16:No. Okay,cute story. So 409 and I went out today to get blue eggs.
6:17:Why?
6:17:Why not? Blue eggs are beautiful and environmentally friendly. ANYWAYS,we bought a chicken. Who wants the chicken?
6:17:What the heck?
6:18:*ScienceApprentice has added DramaQueen to conversation*
6:19:NO.
6:19:*DramaQueen has left conversation*
6:20::'(
6:20:She doesn't want the chicken? Who here DOESN'T want fresh organic eggs?! Jeez. 
6:20:Besides Zelda I mean.
6:21:Well,Marcia doesn't. 
6:23:My mom doesn't like eggs.
6:23:Julius would freak.
6:24:It's reeeeaaalllly fluffy.
6:25:Like,mega fluffy.
6:25:Sorry,Septimus,409. But you really should have thought of that when you bought the chicken.
6:27:Yeah,Syrah's right. Why'd you buy the chicken again?
6:28:It looked into our eyes and stared into our souls.
6:29:Both of your souls?
6:30:It has two eyes. 
6:30:Yeah,one eye for each soul.
6:31:Besides,412 doesn't have a much of soul so it only needed the corner of one eye. 
6:32:HEY! I do have a soul!
6:32:Okay,okay,back to the chicken. Is there anyone here who would like a chicken?
6:33:Do you think you can return it?
6:35:The lady said no refunds on anything! I must say she was very rude about it.
6:36:409,you tried to return something from two years ago.
6:36:It was still fresh!
6:37:Give it back for free?
6:38:I paid 15 bucks for it. No way.
6:39:I dread the day you move out and have to manage your own money.
6:49:Same.
6:50:You're so mean to me. 
6:51:HEY! What about cousin Barry?
6:52:NO. He'd either forget about it and it would die or he'd feed it too many potatoes and it would die. What about your texting buddy?
6:54:Jenna? That's perfect!
6:55:Are you sure that's a good idea?
6:56:I'll take it to them when I go back next weekend! BEETLE YOU ARE A GENIUS.
6:58:I wasn't being serious!
6:58:409! Septimus!
6:59:Okay,I just need to hide the chicken from Marcia for a week. If Jenna's family doesn't want it,we'll think of something else.
7:00:Sigh. Fine.
7:00:All right,I guess.
7:02:Thanks everyone! By the way,Beetle 2.0 is a girl,not an it.
7:03:You're welcome.
7:03:Yeah,anytime.
7:07:Wait- you named it WHAT?!
7:07:*ScienceApprentice has left conversation*
7:08:OOOOOOOOOOOOH
7:08:Am I the only one who found that cowardly?
7:09:DEAD MAN.
9:02:My poor chicken is homeless!
9:07:So I'm guessing the conversion to chickenism failed?
9:10:My foster mother lectured me for an hour about wasting money on unnecessary things and buying animals when I already have a pet and the cost of chicken feed,etc. etc. I was trying to hide the chicken under my shirt so she wouldn't see it but she kept squawking.
9:12:Under your shirt? How long were you planning on hiding it from her?
9:13:About a week,until we find Beetle 2.0 a home. Or until I convert her.
9:13:You should have bought a Chicken Bible.
9:14:You should have suggested that earlier. Anyway,my chemistry teacher convinced her to calm down after a bit,and he said he loves the chicken but can't take her because his house is a fire hazard.
9:16:Aww,that sucks. But how is it a fire hazard? Also,not to be rude,but what is your chemistry teacher doing with you all the time?
9:19:He has lit candles EVERYWHERE and his house is 90% wood. I keep telling him he's going to come home one day to see the house burned down but he won't listen. And it's a weird story.
9:20:Woah. At least he's indestructible. And it can't be weirder than the person who stalked my family for half a year,right? 
9:25:Okay,so after my foster mother had custody of me for about a year I got lost at some science convention thing. My chemistry teacher found me there and took me to his house,since my foster mother had just changed her number and I couldn't remember it and for some reason I hadn't memorized my new address. I was kind of stupid. Anyway,I stayed there for a week,and he really liked me and liked teaching me and all that. After my foster mother found me,she was mad at him for not looking harder for her,and they were both jealous of each other because they're weirdos. Then,about half a year later,I helped him get a job at my school,since he didn't get much income selling skin products.
9:26:My foster mother was really annoyed at him and they fought over me ALL THE TIME. Then she decided that he had some uses and they became friends-ish. He started hanging out at our place a lot,helping me with homework and doing chemistry experiments. My foster mother likes him now,but they still fight over me a lot. And that is how he become part of our sciency family thing.
9:28:That's really cute,actually. And yeah,kind of weird.
9:30:Kind of? He has to be monitored constantly because he's always exploding stuff and lighting things on fire because he doesn't remember that not everyone's indestructible. It's a hassle.
9:31:That's hilarious. I think I love your family too.
9:31:You wouldn't be laughing if you had to spend half your time covered in soot. Let's trade.
9:32:Great,a quiet house with no loud and annoying brothers? Yes PLEASE.
9:34:It's not quiet because everything is exploding,dummy. I'd like some brothers though.
9:35:I highly highly doubt it'd be quieter than my brothers. They even breathe loudly,holy cow. Also my mom keeps giving us the same soup for dinner. I am tired of that soup.
9:35:Yep defiantly trading.
9:36:You mean definitely.
9:38:No,I mean defiantly. We are going to trade families,and by doing so we are being defiant.
9:39:Well,Sep,if it helps you sleep at night...
9:39:Hey!
9:41:Actually I don't think I would feel safe sleeping in the same house as an ex convict/voodoo dude and a guy with a shady girlfriend so we may have to rethink this.
9:41:omg why. Also you are a soon to be convict so you'll fit in just fine.
9:43:409 forgave me for the calculator thing! Also,do you like shoes?
9:44:I guess? I mean I'd love going barefoot everywhere but I need boots to kick people who mess with me and family and friends. So mostly I just wear brown boots.
9:46:Nope nope you are not moving in with my foster mother then. She sees brown boots as blasphemy. Your stay would not be a happy one.
9:47:What does she wear then? 
9:47:Purple python heeled boots with gold buttons.
9:49:CAN I MEET HER?
9:50:NO! YOU ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY SHOED.
9:52:RUDE! Please don't tell me you walk around in green python combat boots with silver caps or something.
9:53:Don't worry,I don't.
9:54:Well,what do you wear then?
9:57:...brown boots.
9:58:WHAT?
10:00:With green laces!
10:03:Okay. I have pink laces?
10:04:Nope,only purple and green allowed,sorry.
10:06:W$Rbusachhfeiska
10:08:Sorry,the chicken just bit me.
10:10:Bad chicken.
10:11:I'm not your chicken.
10:12:I'd be worried and somewhat disturbed if you were. I was just typing that because the chicken can't actually understand me and you're the only I'm talking to right now.
10:13:Interesting logic. Hey,you said your chicken was homeless earlier?
10:14:My foster mother said it will be if I don't find a home for it by the end of the week. Also,just so you know,409 will be back on the weekend.
10:16:Poor Beetle 2.0. Good luck with that. And usually he just shows up in the middle of the night randomly so thanks for the warning. 
10:16:Anyways,I'm eating ice cream with three of my brothers right now. What are you doing? Besides being eaten by the chicken I mean.
10:18:Well,I WAS eating chicken nuggets,but then I suddenly felt really guilty and hid them,since they were probably my chicken's cousin's three times removed in law or something. Now I'm setting up Monopoly,so my chemistry teacher,my foster mother,and 409 and I can play.
10:19:And the chicken is roaming free? Ugh I have a brain freeze right now and my surfer brother ate all the fudge.
10:20:The chicken is hanging out in the corner. And it serves you right for eating ice cream so fast.
10:20:Now the twins ate all the sprinkles! Stupid brothers. Do you have any chicken feed for the chicken? Tell Wolf Boy I said hi.
10:21:Yeah we bought some at the farmer's market. 409 says hi and to save some ice cream for him. 
10:23:Tell him that my oldest brother just came down and took a whole tub up to his room so at the rate they're going they'll be none left.
10:25:Now look what you've done! He's rooting through OUR freezer for ice cream now. And my foster mother is telling me to take the board downstairs.
10:26:Ha ha ha more ice cream for me. All right,have fun. Keep an eye on the chicken.
10:27:No need,Beetle 2.0 loves me. She's following me down,and she looks really fluffy.
10:29:What color is she?
10:30:White. I'll send you a picture tomorrow,but I really should go. Before my chem teacher sets the monopoly bills on fire.
10:32:Goodnight... and my brothers just ate ate all the caramel and peanuts.
10:34:You need new siblings.
10:34:Something I tell myself everyday.
A/N:Ok,I wrote this in about 3 days so it's not the best. I promise the next chapter will be a lot better. Idk I was just writing whatever came to my head? Like,okay Sep has bought a chicken. Sep does not know what to do with the chicken. There is a weird subplot with the chicken. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll edit this later. Btw the thing w/ Jenna's stalker blog thing actually happened to my cousins. And the thing with Jenna thinking Sep is her long lost cousin or something'll be touched on more later. And go google the lady who looks like Harry Potter.
Seriously though,I do not know what I was thinking about the chicken. When I went back it was too late to change it:P Anyways,review please.

A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. I'm sorry for not updating sooner. I guess I'll just say it- I update slow,so every chapter will be a bit of a wait. So this one is shorter than the last two,but I didn't want to drag it out anymore. Idk what I'm writing anymore and it's all so crazy.

8:00:Hello!
8:04:NO.
8:04:SLEEPING.
8:04:BYE. 
8:05:It's already eight!
8:06:SLEEPING.
8:08:Ugh,children these days...
9:35:HEY!
12:19:SHE HAS A FREAKIN GREEN ELECTRIC CAR! IT OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME!
12:25:That's great,Wolf Boy. But you do realize Drama Queen's car does that automatically?
12:26:Shush the car loves me. And how do you know her name? Does 412 spend all day texting you about every detail of his life?
12:26:Not every moment... and of course he talks about his friends. Also,isn't Drama Queen just a code name?
12:27:Yeah,her real one is Bartholomew.
12:27:...That's a boy name.
12:28:Bartholomewia.
12:30:I am so done with you. Also the car does not love you.
12:31:ELECTRIC CAR AND I ARE FOREVER!
12:33:Uh huh. Well,I'm at the mattress store with Nicko right now (as SOMEONE broke my old one!)
12:34:Not my fault 412 pushed me down the stairs while I happened to be sitting on it.
12:34:You asked him to. And dude,you're the one who took it on a four hour drive in the first place. 
12:35:But he was very happy to do it. I didn't take the mattress. It showed up in my trunk.
12:37:You need medical attention:P
12:40:Not even your rudeness can ruin my good mood! SHE HAS A WHOLE FREAKIN STASH OF JUNK FOOD IN THE BACK SEAT! 
12:41:Better than waking up every few mornings for a four hour drive?
12:42:Definitely. Have to admit,that was not my best idea. Plus the buses pollute a lot.
12:45:Well at least you have rich friends with electric cars to take you places.
12:47:412's the only rich one but exactly! Came for the astrophysics department,stayed for the junk food.
12:49:Oh I got to go.
12:49:Ugh same.
2:36:Hey Nicko!
2:39:Hey Jen.
2:41:So I was wondering- do we have any cousins? Anywhere?
2:42:Uhh... no.
2:42:I don't think so.
2:43:Are you sure?
2:44:Yep,I'm pretty darn sure. Dad said once that he might have some cousins something times removed that are our age though.
2:44:That's cool! We should meet them.
2:46:Idk,some are in South Carolina or something and some are in like,Canada.
2:48:Jeez,that's far. 
2:48:Wait,where in Canada?
2:49:I think Toronto or nearby?
2:50:Hmph,yeah,that's far away.
2:51:Why do you want cousins all of a sudden? Rupert- you know,from the Jannit's Boat Shop- said he has cousins and all they do is fight.
2:52:Rupert likes fighting and throwing stuff so I'm not surprised.
2:53:Me neither. Which is why I didn't tell him. Hey,what are you doing?
2:53:Si's taking us for frozen yogurt. We're going to pick you up.
2:54:Jeez,some warning would've been nice. I'm in the middle of fixing this mast!
2:54:Oh,I can see you all.
2:55:Frozen yogurt is actually ugly ice cream.
2:56:Just get in the car,Nik.
3:00:Are you awake yet?
3:06:Of course I am! What do you take me for?
3:08:One of those people that sleep for a jillion years on the weekend.
3:09:No I don't. I woke up at nine.
3:10:I assumed you just sent the text and went back to sleep. You said you usually sleep until 2 which is basically a jillion years.
3:10:2 is completely normal. You're the one who wakes up early to clean the freaking library. Anyways,what are you doing?
3:11:Taking Beetle 2.0 for a walk around around SSS's neighborhood. She keeps trying to eat the daisies. I think my chem teacher is rubbing off on her.
3:12:Except she's not indestructible:(
3:12:What about you?
3:14:I'm at a frozen yogurt place with all my brothers. It's one of those places where they give you a cup and then you put any sort of flavors and toppings then weigh it. I just got chocolate and some berries. 
3:14:Ugh my map brother is getting avocado and eggplant.
3:15:Yum.
3:17:Yum?! What do you mean yum it's disgusting!
3:18:Chocolate is gross. The eggplant thing actually sounds good. Is it purple?
3:18:No it's a weird beige. And I'm questioning your sanity right now. What is wrong with you?
3:19:...And now he's adding ginger. Who the heck makes ginger flavored frozen yogurt?
3:20:I like him. Tell him I approve of his taste. And so does Beetle 2.0.
3:22:He's literally adding every flavor now... compared to him you sound perfectly sane right now.
3:23:Oh yeah,sure,I'll go up to him and tell him that this random Nevada boy who I don't even know likes your taste in yogurt and so does his chicken,even though you're probably going to poison yourself with that.
3:24:Do it:D
3:24:No.
3:25::'(
3:27:My oldest brother says he'll pay for all of us! YES!
3:28:Lucky! The last time I got ice cream with Beetle and 409,the bill kept mysteriously falling next to my bowl until I paid.
3:28:Ha ha.
3:28:Yeah,they're terrible.
3:30 OMG IM LAUGHING SO HARD RIGHT NOW!
3:30:I'm*
3:31:DUDE.
3:32:It hurts my eyes. So,why the laughing? 
3:33:The twins's yogurt broke the scale... literally. The cashier is not happy and the twins look like they regret nothing.
3:34:And now my oldest brother's saying he's not going to pay for theirs anymore. They're regretting it now ha ha ha ha.
3:34:So you're a sadist,I see.
3:35:Hey,says the boy who hit his friend with the calculator. Oooh the cashier is saying they have to pay for the scale too. Their total of the yogurt without the scale is already $30 plus. And my surfer and emo brothers just broke the strawberry lever. My oldest brother is pretending he's not related to them. 
3:35:Oh my gosh,your family. And that was one time!
3:35:Who hits their 'very best friend' with calculators?! Anyway,it's not working because they all look too much alike. I,however,can pretend I don't know them and completely get away with it and enjoy the show.
3:37:Darn.
3:37:What?
3:37:My surfer brother just yelled HEY SIS and ruined it! Now they know that I know these lunatics.
3:38:HAHHAHAH laughing again HA ha aha HBABAbdjnsmacx
3:39:The last part looks like you just gave up and smashed the phone. Now what?
3:40:They thought my oldest brother was their dad and tried to drag him up there and he said no these aren't my children and I didn't ask for this and ran out the door with his yogurt. Now my map brother is in charge and he looks confused.
3:42:I really want to meet them now. Ugh,this neighborhood is boring I wish I was in CA.
3:45:You should come! It's cool here,tell Wolf Boy to bring you. 
3:45:So I can laugh at you to your face. ...Aw,now everyone has mostly calmed down and it's boring. The twins are bringing out the cash. The map one is still confused. He was at the flavor station the whole time and I don't think he figured out what's happening yet.
3:46:Hey,my face is very good! What about the voodoo brother? Where is he?
3:47:NOT VOODOO. He's outside telling some poor guy he's going to need therapy with a family like this. And eating his yogurt without us. The guy is backing away slowly as he manically chugs it down.
3:48:Yeah,you probably are ALL going to need it. Especially you!
3:50:How rude! So are you still walking Beetle 2.0? Or are you doing something else right now?
3:51:Still walking her. But right now we're outside SSS's house and waiting for her to come down. I can hear her dad and my chem teacher yelling at each other on the phone from out here.
3:52:From what I can hear of the argument,I've deduced that there is a dog involved.
3:52:Wait,what? Your chemistry teacher and your friend's dad are arguing?
3:53:Yep. They go waaaaay back. They're like,high school frenemies.
3:53:And SSS is here! She's coming down the stairs.
3:54:Tell her I said hi:D
3:56... and her dad's hand just appeared and yanked her back in. Apparently she didn't do her homework yet.
3:57:Wow plot twist. Poor SSS. What are you going to do,then?
3:58:I'll sneak in and help her,I think.
4:00:With the chicken?
4:01:Do not underestimate the chicken. It shall follow where I go. In this case,though SSS's window.
4:01:Okay,good luck.
4:02:How the heck will the chicken get through the window?
4:03:DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE CHIKKKKEEENNNN!
4:03:Okay... And now the twins have finished paying. My emo brother has black yogurt and I don't think I even want to know what flavor it it.
4:05:Blackberry,maybe? I'm in a tree right now. I can see straight into SSS's dad's office and he's Skyping my chem teacher. Also Beetle 2.0 is an excellent climber.
4:06:Isn't blackberry like,pinkish purple? Why are you stalking her dad you creepy person? My map brother has finally finished putting in all the flavors and now he's going to weigh it on the new scale.
4:06:Bet the cashier is scared. And I'm not stalking him! I just happened to be there. Anyway I can see SSS's room now. 
4:07:*changes contact name to Stalker*
4:07:The cashier is shaking her head frantically because his looks like it weighs more than the twins's. His arms are actually straining.
4:07:Hey! 
4:08:*changes contact name to Thirty Year Old Potato Man*
4:09:What?!
4:10:Ha ha inside joke.
4:10:Potato man?! What the heck Septimus I don't even eat potatoes.
4:12:YOU DON'T EAT POTATOES?
4:13:NO.
4:13:WHY.
4:13:BECAUSE.
4:14:THAT'S A TERRIBLE REASON. What's happening with your brothers?
4:17:EXCUSE YOU IT'S WONDERFUL. Holy gumballs the cashier just told my map brother to just give her twenty bucks and get out of the shop and after he handed them over she kicked us all out and put up the closed sign. My brother is saying he feels like he missed something big and the rest of us are like,you think?
4:17:He's the only one with frozen yogurt left since we all finished our's an hour ago. 
4:18:Anyway I have to go now because we need to locate our oldest brother. Ttyl.
4:18:Yeah SSS just noticed me so me too. Bye!
5:07:Septimus!
5:13:Drama Queen?
5:15:Ugh I told you it's Lucy. Can you come over?
5:16:Yeah,sure. Why? Can Beetle 2.0 come?
5:17:I just built a giant Eiffel Tower made of legos and you must see it. Who's Beetle 2.0?
5:19:Cool! Be there in fifteen minutes.
5:19:Remember the chicken I bought yesterday? You did read the chat before you rudely left it,right?
5:20:I read the chat and then left it because of the pure stupidity of the situation.
5:21:Oh my gosh. Please don't tell me you named the chicken Beetle 2.0.
5:21:It's a perfect name. It fits her soul.
5:23:...
5:23::)
5:23:...Yeah,bring the chicken. Are you sure keeping it is a good idea? What if it eats Spit Fyre?
5:24:She won't. I showed her Spit Fyre and she got bored and stomped away. Spit Fyre was insulted. Also,409 is going to give her away to a family he knows next week.
5:25:Hey,can Syrah come? We're doing homework together.
5:26:Sure! Come quick before Rupert comes back from work and accidentally steps on the tower or something.
5:27:Knowing you it's probably six feet. How'll he step on that?
5:28:My brother is strangely talented.
5:29:That's true. Are you referring to the Great Crash of 2k14?
5:29:STOP. I keep trying to forget that and someone always brings it up! 
5:30:But you have to admit it wouldn't have happened if you hadn't caused the Great Flood of 2k14.
5:31:I'm just going to say that it was entirely not my fault and I cannot be held responsible.
5:31:Lucy,that was probably the guiltiest text I've ever read.
5:43:YOU NAMED THE CHICKEN BEETLE 2.0?!
5:45:YES I APOLOGIZE I HAVE PRAYED FOR FORGIVENESS.
5:47:YOU NAMED THE CHICKEN BEETLE.
5:47:2.0.
5:48:YES.
5:49:YOU NAMED A CHICKEN AFTER ME.
5:50:Yes.
5:52:A CHICKEN.
5:53:Yes stay with the program.
5:55:A CHICKEN.
5:57:Good Lord,Sep.
5:58:Would you like to meet her?
6:00:You named a GIRL CHICKEN after me?!
6:02:Uh,never mind,I'll give it a few days. Bye Beetle.
6:03:1.0.
6:04:I will track you down and poke you.
6:05:The dreaded poke! The horror,the horror.
6:07:Hey,Sep,I know where you live.
6:09:I'M EVACUATING!
6:11:Actually I'm at Luce's.
6:20:What a coincidence I'm at her door!
6:24:Septimus,are you going to tell me why you just aggressively jumped out of my window?
6:25:NOPE GOTTA RUN BYEEE.
6:49:I'm hiding in the library and I found a self help book called What to do When Your Brother is Going to Jail and I think you should get it.
6:51:Well,I found a book once called How to Cope When You Know You're Headed to Jail and I think YOU should get it.
6:51:Why are you hiding in the library?
6:53:Beetle is not pleased at my name choice for Beetle 2.0 and I am on the run for my life as he knows where I live.
6:54:What are you doing?
6:56:Well,my map brother didn't finish his frozen yogurt and shoved it in the freezer,and he's brought it out now. It's got all the flavors mixed together and all my brothers are going to try it. I'm on the standby in case they poison themselves.
6:58:That sounds reasonable. But you should wait 24 hours for symptoms before you know if it was poison for sure.
6:59:But it'll be gone then! If they don't die now,I think I'll try it.
7:01:I spoke too soon about you,Jenna. That is stupid logic.
7:02:They literally all just ate it! If I don't,I'll look like a chicken.
7:04:Wait. Is your chicken in the library?!
7:06:No,there was some kid named Barney Pot outside who really liked her and offered to watch her. Because she's fluffy.
7:07:Okay... that sounds like a bad idea but okay.
7:08:What if she wasn't fluffy though? Who would have watched her?
7:09:The real question is,would you have bought her?
7:11:The world we live in is so fluffist. We judged the chickens's hearts on their outward amount of fluff. I am guilty of this. I even tried to convince my foster mother about Beetle 2.0 because she was fluffy.
7:12:That literally makes no sense but it sounds deep.
7:14:Also,sheep that don't get their wool sheared can die of fluffiness. I feel like there's some social commentary in there but I can't verbalize it.
7:15:I hope you can feel my face-palm through the phone. 
7:15:THE FROZEN YOGURT TASTES LIKE MOTOR OIL.
7:16:Are you speaking from experience? And do you have ice cream? It can get rid of bad tastes pretty fast.
7:18:It tastes like how motor oil smells. I think we finished it last night but I'll go check. Brb.
7:20:Good luck!
7:43:So we had a little ice cream left and split it seven ways. We haven't thrown up or anything yet,so that's promising.
7:45:Wow. Okay,I'm not coming to your funeral if this is how you die. You deserve it.
7:48:Hey,you were the one who was going on about how good those stupid flavors sounded. If I don't end up dying,will you visit me in the hospital? Dressed as a clown?
7:49:I'm not dressing up like a clown! And those flavors sounded good on their own but not all mixed together.
7:49:Hmph. How can I convince you?
7:51:You can't,sorry. You'll have to die on your own.
7:52:Excuse me if I die all my brothers will be there and my parents and friends and the freaking gigantic extended family so no I will not die on my own.
7:53:Your brothers won't be there because they'll be dying from the frozen yogurt as well.
7:54:This is really depressing. You're not invited to my funeral.
7:54::(
7:55:Well the day before yesterday you said you weren't inviting me to yours:P
7:58:If I invite you to mine can I come to yours?
7:59:Won't I theoretically be dead by then?
8:00:Your coffin can come.
8:02:This is literally the weirdest conversation I've ever had.
8:03:Ha same.
8:03:Well my foster mother is calling me so I have to go.
8:05:Yeah,me too. Bye!
8:06:Bye!
8:34:Hey Septimus,I'm coming to dinner.
8:38:Yeah! Marcia just told me she invited you!
8:40:Julius is coming too... is Marcellus there?
8:40:No,I think he's at his house grading papers. 409 is here,though.
8:41:Oh no,wait,Marcellus is upstairs exploding stuff.
8:43:Oh dear.
8:44:Yeah,this is going to an interesting dinner.
9:19:So I think your brothers's craziness somehow wirelessly transferred from my phone to our dinner table. 
9:22:What concoction have they created?
9:25:SSS's dad calls it the Milkshake of Horror.
9:25:409 is calling it his child.
9:25:SSS and my foster mother are just calling it disgusting
9:27:What about you?
9:28:I'm calling it an abomination. I want it out of my sight.
9:29:Ugh,SSS just took a sip. She's got a good poker face.
9:31:Take a drink! Take a drink!
9:32:Heck no! 
9:32:Oh great,now her dad is starting on it too. Exact same face. It's kind of weird how much they look alike.
9:33:He IS her dad. It'd be weird if they didn't look a little alike,right?
9:34:Oh,I didn't tell you. She's adopted.
9:36:Oh,that's cool.
9:38:My chemistry teacher just took a sip!
9:38:Do it,Sep. Your entire life will flash before your eyes.
9:39:I'm not really interested in seeing it again.
9:41:Oh,wonderful,409 has had a drink.
9:42:You have to up-show him!
9:42:I know. I do.
9:44:No,wait,I was joking!
9:45:I wasn't. I can't lose to 409. Wish me luck.
9:45:It's been nice knowing you.
9:46:Wish I could say the same.
9:48:Hey!
10:00:Are you alive?
10:01:I was joking. Please be alive.
10:02:I don't want dead texting buddies on my conscience!
10:05:I am barely alive.
10:07:That's good enough for me!
10:07:Unlike you,I would actually attend your funeral.
10:08:Thanks for the offer,but I wouldn't want you there.
10:10:Why not?!
10:11:Because you'd make some weird dramatic speech!
10:11:I mean yeah,you're not wrong but
10:13:Nope,not invited.
10:15:You make a lousy corpse.
10:16:Oh yeah? Because I'm going to go play video games with 409 and SSS probably until three in the morning.
10:16:That's impossible. You have school tomorrow. Also won't your foster mother/principle find out?
10:18:No,probably not. And I'm an expert at staying up late on school nights. Also SSS's dad and my chemistry teacher are still here,so she'll be distracted by them. They're probably going to stay overnight.
10:19:That's really irresponsible,you know.
10:21:Because you're so responsible. I'm going to go get the games out. Night,Jenna.
10:21:Hey,I'm responsible! Night,Sep.
12:03:You took a freaking chicken on a walk.
12:05:Shut up Jenna.
A/N:Ok,I wrote this in about 3 days again for literally no reason and now I'm tired of looking at it. I'm just going to say,I guess if you want me to update faster and better,reviews help. They're pretty motivating. Also,I'm curious,what was your favorite part so far? Whose texts do you like reading the most?
So I've been thinking about this universe and I realized that there are 10 million plot holes,and I'm going to try and work through all of them. So if there's an inconsistency you've spotted,I'm probably going to explain it soon. Anyway,thanks,and review please.

A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. So,you know I have no life when I update twice in less than a week. Also this is because I'm going on a trip to an internet less place so no updates then. Boo.
So this one is short but be happy because I updated quick,okay? Even if this chapter sorta sucks. Because it's a bit hard to drag out school days. And you'll be happy to know I plotted out the whole story. It'll have 14 chapters,I think.
edit:I got bored so I drew a cover for this. then my app broke. i am so sad.
Bold- Septimus;Italics- Jenna;Underline bold italics- Syrah;Normal- Beetle;Underline bold- Wolf Boy. (I was trying to get snorri to text jenna but I couldn't squeeze her in:P)
7:24:Good morning! Should I get Italian or wheat bread for my sandwich?
7:29:Morning! Italian,obviously. 
7:31:You answered too slow. 
7:31:So I got wheat.
7:32:Eww.
7:34:Hey! What's wrong with wheat? I guess I'll try Italian next time but wheat is really good,especially with cabbage.
7:35:Wheat bread is awful! I can't believe you even had to consider getting it as a another option.
7:38:Don't be mean. Wheat bread never did anything to you.
7:38:You don't know my life. Maybe it viciously attacked me as a child.
7:38:You were attacked by bread? I'm not sure if I should pity you or be disappointed.
7:39:Either way,I am very sorry for your trauma.
7:41:Thank you.
7:42:Okay,but in all seriousness,one of the twins thought I was the ball for their game once (don't ask) and tried to make me roll by smacking me with a loaf of wheat bread.
7:43:Woah. How'd he mistake you for a ball? You should write a book about your family. It'd sell like wildfire.
7:45:Yeah,and I'll give you the first copy free.
7:45:So,I'm on the bus right now. Why are you eating sandwiches?
7:46:I'm in the car with my foster mother and chemistry teacher and we're parking at the school. So my foster mother decided to just take me with her (since she has to get there earlier) and as a consolation for my missed sleep she took us to Subway for breakfast.
7:47:Lucky. I had to eat rice krispies for breakfast since my mum and dad ate all the bread last night.
7:48:Why?
7:48:I have literally no idea. Anyway I have to get off now. Also,looking back on our texts last night,the government is definitely coming after us.
7:50:...Darn. And I was so enjoying not being chased!
7:50:Hey isn't Beetle coming after you as well for the chicken thing?
7:51:I shall hide behind a tall person.
7:52:That's nice.
8:16:You didn't tell me you have seven look alikes in California!
8:18:HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
8:19:409 did some fancy hacking things while he got you the emoji app. He just sent all the texts to me.
8:20:Haven't any of you ever heard of privacy? And that's a weird thing to just drop into conversations.
8:21:You read my mail yesterday. And we've talked stranger things before.
8:21:You referred to me as SSS the whole time?!
8:22:You literally gave the letter to me and told me to read it! And it's called internet safety.
8:23:I'm deleting the conversation from my phone because I am a nice person.
8:24:Unfortunately,I am not a nice person and I will come after you.
8:24:You don't even kill the spiders in the library!
8:25:Watch me.
9:07:I am once again on my way to the principle's office.
9:09:Why do I feel like you live there? 
9:11:There may or may not be a chair with my name written on the back in sharpie.
9:11:Of course there is. What did you do this time? School only started an hour ago!
9:12:The tall person I tried to hide behind was our English teacher and I accidentally startled him and he stubbed his toe on a desk. 
9:14:Oh no.
9:15:Honestly he's overreacting. Though I did start cheering earlier when he announced we'd be discussing Lord of the Rings and that might've made him annoyed.
9:15:Nerd.
9:15:You should write a book called Septimus (insert last name here):a list of reasons why I've been sent to the principle's office. 
9:16:It shall be in German so my English teacher can't read it.
9:16:Got to go. My foster mother will understand and hopefully I won't get detention!
9:17:Good luck with that.
9:33:No detention. She just took some aspirin and told me to refrain from cheering loudly and hiding behind tall people.
9:35:Yeah,that's pretty solid advice.
9:36:And now Syrah's trying to get me to come to the student council meeting... BLEH I don't feel like it.
9:36:You never said you were on the student council! And is Syrah SSS?
9:36:SHE'S GRABBING MY PHONE THE TRAITOR BSJFS*&TUjsfasnjmz
9:38:Yes I am. I have now taken his phone to try and get him to come and also because he's going to turn into a zombie at this rate.
9:40:Oh,my bad. Septimus doesn't really sound like the type to be on the council though.
9:41:He actually does a pretty good job there. He wasn't even running but half the school voted for him anyway,and that's how he got in.
9:41:That's actually really funny. Are you on the council too?
9:42:No. Apparently I'm good at decorating,though,and they're holding a school dance soon. Beetle asked me (with permission of course) to sit in on this one.
9:43:Speaking of this school's leadership,Sep gets sent to the office a lot for the principle's foster son.
9:45:I'm very aware. By the way,he's reaching for the phone so I'll go now. Nice talking to you.
9:46:You too!
9:48:I'm back and tied to a chair in our meeting class room. I guess there goes Syrah's secret identity.
9:49:Syrah is a really pretty name. When's the student council meeting?
9:50:Now. They're talking about a dance. Ugh why am I here?
9:51:TO SUPPORT BEETLE! Don't you like dances? Also you never told me you were on the council. I'm on my school's.
9:51:Well you never told me that either! Oh yeah and Beetle stopped chasing me. And I like small little parties but not big dances because I have two left feet. 
9:52:Ugh can you guess what Drama Queen just suggested? 
9:53:Probably not.
9:53:Paint. I don't understand how that'll work. And Syrah just said under the sea. She has a water complex although it's partly her dad's fault.
9:54:Under the sea sounds nice. Do you have any ideas?
9:55:Yeah,Beetle just asked me. I said book characters or zombie apocalypse and they said no.
9:55:Disappointing. It actually would've looked cool,to be honest.
9:56:Exactly! But only Drama Queen liked it. And now 409 broke in and said we should do hobos of the forest.
9:57:We kicked him out.
9:59:How rude. Decided on a theme yet?
10:01:Nope. Syrah suggested under the sea again,Partridge wanted Romans/Greeks,and Beetle said we should pick one color then all dress up in that. Oh Drama Queen just said royalty and wizards. That sounds interesting.
10:03:It does. So like,medieval themed? You should go as a princess. You have the hair for it:P
10:04:Ha ha. Very funny. And I'll be a wizard,not a princess. A wizard apprentice,maybe. What are you doing?
10:04:Oh well. Maybe Wolf Boy can be the princess. I'm going to chemistry now. You?
10:05:I'm free of council and heading over to Math. Pray that no one dies.
10:06:Are you talking students or characters?
10:07:Both.
10:16:I have a substitute for chemistry and it's my brother!
10:18:The voodoo one,right? Cool!
10:20:No,not voodoo and not cool! It's so embarrassing.
10:21:Blackmail him into giving you good grades.
10:22:Speaking from experience? I can't because he's only the substitute.
10:22:For every piece of blackmail I have about my foster mother,she has 58 for me. You know,I thought you'd be one of those people who like having a teacher whom they are related to.
10:23:Yeah,I thought so too.
10:23:He winked at me! This is so embarrassing.
10:24:Hide behind a tall person.
10:26:Tall person located.
11:02:Guess who attended P.E. today!
11:04:What did you do?
11:07:You have alarmingly little trust in me.
11:08:I wonder why.
11:08:The school pool may or may not be filled with blue dye. Thus,everyone in our class (minus me) may or may not be completely blue.
11:09:Oh my God. How is your foster mother today?
11:11:Very angry. Sadly I have just come back from a lecture.
11:11:You deserve it! I mean,it's not even midday. And thanks to you I have become scarily good at hiding my phone from teachers.
11:12:I've been suspended! And it's nine pm somewhere.
11:13:SUSPENDED?
11:14:Yep,no school for a week. I'm heartbroken.
11:15:Who's going to drop you back?
11:15:A taxi. I'm in there now actually.
11:16:Should I expect a blue Wolf Boy home today? He told my surfer brother he's driving back.
11:18:A blue Wolf Boy with avatar tattoos drawn on him. Apparently my revenge backfired,and him and Syrah are very happy with their makeovers. The rest of the class,however...
11:18:I better be invited to your funeral.
11:20:We've already been over this. But send a cake over.
11:23:I'm pretty sure I should be invited if I'm providing snacks.
11:24:Nope. Anyway I have to go now because my foster mother apparently changed her mind,left the deputy principle in charge,and is home and ready with another lecture. Lovely.
11:27:What did you expect,dying your whole class blue?
11:28:Be quiet.
12:22:YOU ARE A DEAD MAN SEPTIMUS OVERSTRAND!
12:24:Hello Beetle. How are you today? I must say you looked stunning in blue earlier.
12:24:Also that's not my real last name.
12:25:I decided to be nice and just live with a girl chicken named after me in my life but this. YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS!
12:27:I am merely an innocent victim.
12:27:YOU'RE NOT EVEN BLUE! Except for your hands!
12:28:My circulation's just been cut off from texting too much. And I don't swim,that's Syrah's forte... but I have been suspended.
12:32:GOOD! Marcia did all the paperwork and everything? Alther's taking over for today so hopefully she's yelling at you.
12:34:Sadly,yes. I need some new ears.
12:36:Your ridiculous pranks are getting worse and worse.
12:40:409's the prankster (and Partridge sometimes). I only occasionally break the rules and it's usually by accident.
12:42:Right. So it wasn't you who moved all the furniture in Ms. Djinn's classroom to the roof with her asleep on the couch.
12:45:That was 409's idea,and we did that three and a half weeks ago. She still hasn't noticed. I'm getting tired of walking so far just for math. The only reason Marcia hasn't done anything about it is because she hates her.
12:47:You're an idiot. As soon as I get home I'm going to take twelve showers.
12:48:I don't think that will work. It's supposed to last three/two weeks.
12:48:I'M soRRY!
12:50:DEAD MAN!
3:05:Been lectured yet?
3:10:Several times. You'd think I did something wrong!
3:12:Don't you have a dance coming up? Because unless you go with under the sea most people won't want to be blue then.
3:13:SSS sure does. When I was leaving I saw her swimming in the pool again,while Drama Queen tried to pull her out only to fall in herself.
3:17:Your friends are going to murder you in your sleep.
3:21:I'm suddenly thankful for my foster mother's weird security system. Wait Syrah and Drama Queen know the password... I'm doomed.
3:22:Oh no blue Drama Queen walking in. I leave everything to Beetle 2.0 and Spit Fyre.
3:25:Don't I get anything!? What's the point in having rich friends?
4:03:I'm alive and technically I'm not rich because it's all my foster mother's money and even she's not that rich.
4:06:But the mansion?
4:07:It's inherited from her teacher. And it's completely purple on the inside.
4:10:That sounds like a grape. 
4:11:I got to go. I'm about to get in the water.
4:13:Ugh swimming.
4:13:Surfing actually.
4:16:Still water.
4:32:409 YOU FORGOT THE CHICKEN!
4:37:WHOOPS I ALREADY CHANGED BUSES!
4:39:OH WELL. I'm coming back tomorrow morning for school and I'll take Beetle 2.0 then.
4:41:Please do. She pecked Marcia's shoes and you know what that means.
4:42:War?
4:42:Close enough.
4:45:Also I AM SO HAPPY I'M BLUE.
4:47:My revenge backfired.
4:50:Dude this is more like a token of appreciation.
6:00:Hey Wolf Boy,are you back yet?
6:03:Of course not. I have like two hours left. I should just move in with 412.
6:05:412 is Septimus,right? Anyway I won't be home when you get back,and neither will Nicko and Jo-Jo. We're in the hospital.
6:07:Yeah and please tell me Jo-Jo's just hanging around and stalking the doctors again and you two decided to watch.
6:09:Nicko and I both wiped out and crashed into a rock. We've got some scrapes and need a couple of stitches and according to Jo-Jo the doctor's doing it wrong.
6:10:DUDE! Are you guys okay?
6:11:According to Jo-Jo we will be if the doctor doesn't gives us poison instead of anesthetic.
6:13:He's the worst person ever to have in that room.
6:15:That's what the doctor keeps muttering.
6:18:You're not even going to get to see me!
6:20:You look like an Avatar. Septimus told me,and besides he says it lasts two weeks.
6:21:Oh darn.
6:23:Did he tell you they forgot to close the pool for the rest of the classes? And free swim at lunch. More than half the school is blue and I am so happy.
6:24:He got suspended before he could find out. I'll mention it to him when I tell him about the stitches.
6:28:Aww poor baby.
6:31:Shut up. Wait aren't you on the bus? Has anyone commented on your new makeover?
6:34:I spent half the day working the costume to perfection. A couple people screamed and another one asked me to take them to my leader. I love people.
6:35:I still can't believe you and Septimus are friends.
6:35:Our friendship is awesome. Ask him what we did to Ms. Djinn's classroom three weeks ago.
6:38:I'm scared. Speaking of which the so called doctor is done and Jo-Jo is eyeing the needles. If someone doesn't stop him he might try to sew up my leg again.
6:40:Give him some anesthetic too. I gotta change buses again.
7:15:So I thought you would like to know that your school forgot to close the pool and now the majority of the students are blue.
7:18:Oh no. There will be an angry mob of smurfs after me!
7:20:Send photos of the angry smurf mob please.
7:21:I'm so glad I'm not going back to school for another week. And will do if they don't kill me first.
7:21:Wolf Boy has taken advantage of his new look and spent the afternoon and evening scaring bus drivers.
7:22:Oh no. So he finished his avatar costume then?
7:25:Apparently.
7:27:Hey won't he be at your place by now? He said he was having dinner with you guys.
7:30:I'm sorta in the hospital.
7:31:WHAT? ARE YOU OKAY?!
7:33:It was just a little surfing accident. My brother and I will be back at school in a couple of days with stitches and crutches.
7:35:Great when you get back to school everyone will be worried,but when I get back they'll be murderous.
7:36:Maybe you shouldn't have smurfified half the school.
7:41:Firstly,that's not a real word. Secondly,I only meant to dye my swimming class (meaning 409 and Syrah).
7:43:You mean the only two people happy with this?!
7:44:...I didn't think it through very well. Anyway I'm going to SSS's house right now which is a water hazard so I won't be texting.
7:46:How can a house be a water hazard? Fire hazard I understand. Plus our phones are waterproof.
7:48:There's a moat,a pool on every floor,and two water slides. And also a heck ton of sand.
7:48:CAN I COME?
7:49:I feel like I explain this to you everyday. It's a four hour drive so no.
7:52:True true. Oh well,have fun at the water park/house. And tell Syrah I said hi!
7:54:Will do! And I'll be spending my time there moving the furniture in front of people coming down the slide.
7:58:That's so mean:(
8:00:Always:D
A/N:In case any of you are wondering why Lucy or 409 didn't comment on there being Septimus in Nevada to the other Heaps,it's because Septimus is already happy with Marcia,and it's such a weird thing to think that they'd have an extra random sibling chilling out there. They don't think he's closely related to them because it's such a coincidental concept. And it's weird. Anyway,the plot thickens in chapter 7,so stay tuned and review and everything. Bye.
