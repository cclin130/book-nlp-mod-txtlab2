A/N:I don't own Septimus Heap. This is not an AU. Up until Flyte,when Milo was prisoner on Deakin Lee's ship,he thought Jenna and Queen Cerys were dead. It's based off the sentence in Fyre:"And she began to understand that Milo,too,had lost his own what-might-have-been." 
Violet,Red,and Gold
Sometimes he falls asleep to the rocking of his ship and dreams of swirls of violet,red,and gold.
He dreams of little girls with circlets on their heads and gowns of silk,of a Palace filled with noise and laughter. He dreams of a daughter with Cerys's adventurous spirit and his love of the sea,of candlelit windows shining in the night. He dreams of tennis games and climbing vines,of books of names stacked in the corner. He dreams of the little family he's always wanted and of time spent at home,of sunlight days that passed in a blur.
He dreams of two little daughters and two little sons,with violet eyes and dressed in red and gold.
He wakes up when the ship lurches and remembers that he is captured on Deakin Lee's ship and what he once had is lost. He remembers that Cerys and his baby daughter are dead,and that the family he's always dreamed of will never be a reality.
A/N:That was short,but I hope it's okay. Please review if you can:)
