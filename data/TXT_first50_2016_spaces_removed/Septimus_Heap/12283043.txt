Jenna walked down from her room in the Palace. She had just returned from a long trip to the House of Foryx and had taken up some much-needed rest. The young princess reached the kitchen where she found Sarah Heap making breakfast.
"Hi,mum." Jenna said,sitting down at the table.
Sarah turned around. "Oh,Jenna!" She came over and gave Jenna a big hug.
"How was your trip? Did you sleep well. Here I've prepared breakfast for you. Egg and sausage,your favorite." Sarah flashed her daughter a smile as she put the plate of breakfast at the table for Jenna.
Jenna smiled,satisfied to see a well-cooked home meal. She always knew she had the best mom in the world.
"The trip was fun," Jenna said in between bites. "I met with Hotep-Ra again and he was doing well."
"Oh that's good," Sarah said. "That's very good."
Jenna looked up at her mother. "How's Sep and Beetle doing? Gosh,it's been years."
Sarah smiled. "It's only been a week,honey. And they're doing well. They've missed you,they really have."
Jenna smiled back. "I've missed them too. They haven't been in much trouble have they?"
"No,they've been good,Jenna. Maybe because you've been gone," Sarah teased.
"Did I really get them into trouble that often?" Jenna asked,curious now that her mother brought it up.
"Maybe a little. They don't know this but they're head over heels for you." Sarah said,getting up from her seat.
Jenna's smile dropped. "What does that mean,mum?"
Sarah placed her dish into the water basin.
"Mum?" Jenna asked again when Sarah did not respond immediately.
Sarah turned back around and smiled again. "Don't take it so serious,Jens. You're beautiful,everyone is head over heels for you. Now go on and visit your brothers,it's time you catch up. We'll talk later." And with that Sarah left the Kitchen,leaving Jenna by herself.
What in the world was her mum going on about?
