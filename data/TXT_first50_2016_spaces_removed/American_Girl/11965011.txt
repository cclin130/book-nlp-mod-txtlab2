The next morning,Libbi awoke,feeling hot.
'Mom,I'm hot.' Libbi signed.
Forty-two-year-old Lea Blackman felt Libbi's forehead. She was hot.
'I'm goint to send for Dr. Burger.' Lea fingerspelled. It was about this time Samantha and Nellie came for Libbi.
"I'm sorry,girls. Libbi has a possible fever,so I'm sending for Dr. Burger right now."
After Lea rode away in the buggy,Samantha and Nellie walked in. They had an hour before school started.
"Let's just go in and say hello." Samantha said.
Samantha and Nellie approached the bed. Samantha took one hand and Nellie took the other. Libbi sat up and felt who was on her right.
'Hi Nellie,hi Samantha.'
'Your mom told us you were sick.' Nellie fingerspelled.
'She thinks I'm sick whenever I'm hot or cold. It's ridiculous.'
'We came in to say hi on our way to school. We'll be by later with your homework. You know Mrs. Smith is a firm believer in homework.'
Libbi shook her head in disgust.
Lea came in,followed by Dr. Burger.
"Hello girls." Lea said curtly. "I suppose you had a good little visit with Libbi? Good,now you can be on your way. This way,Dr. Burger."
Lea led Dr. Burger to Libbi's room.
'Good-morning,Libbi.' Dr. Burger fingerspelled. Libbi,with her eyes closed,lifted her hand to touch Dr. Burger's face.
Dr. Burger checked Libbi's temp. High. She was pale and losing conciousness.
"Looks like the fever is back."
"What's it going to do this time?" Lea fretted.
"I don't know. Send for me if her conditon improves/worsens. Good day,Ms. Blackman."
After Dr. Burger left,sixty-nine-year-old Quinton Blackman entered the house.
"Hello Lea."
"Hello Father." Lea said,not looking up from her embroidery.
"What's that you're doing?" Quinton asked.
"Embroidery. What does it look like?"
"Lea,what's up with you today?"
"I just got the news that your granddaughter's fever has returned. Do you think I'm going to have a good day?"
"May I go up and see her?"
"Why do you need permission?"
Quinton went up the stairs and into Libbi's room. He pulled up a chair beside the bed and took Libbi's hand in his. Libbi recognized the callused hand as his and turned her head toward him,eyes closed.
With his other hand,Quinton brushed Libbi's red hair out of her face.
'I'm sorry you're not feeling well. I have something that might cheer you up.'
Quinton placed a doll he bought at Hinson's General Store into Libbi's arm.
Libbi ran her hand over the doll.
'Thank-you,Grandpa.'
Later that day,Samantha and Nellie brought over Libbi's homework.
"Hello Ms. Blackman." Samantha said. "How's Libbi feeling? We brought Libbi her homework."
"She's doing better girls. I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you this morning. Go on up and see her."
Samantha and Nellie went up to Libbi's room. She was sitting up in bed,reading her book.
'I'm glad you're feeling better.' Nellie fingerspelled.
'Me too.' Samantha copied.
