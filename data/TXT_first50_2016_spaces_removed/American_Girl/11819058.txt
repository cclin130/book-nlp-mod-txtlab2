Dear Diary,
Hello my name is Caroline Abbott. My father is the best shipbuilder in all of New York. I live with my mother,my grandmother,my father,and my cat Inkpot. I decided to start my new diary yesterday because it was a Sabbath day. I want to talk about Christmas because it is in a few days,and people started showing up today. I have been working on my presents since Hallows Eve,but today Mama told me that I need to give everyone that's coming a present. I don't think I have enough floss to sew all those presents. Anyway I have to help Grandmother make some pie crusts.
Love,
Caroline
