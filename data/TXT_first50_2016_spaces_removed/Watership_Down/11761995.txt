Deep-scratched furrows scoring the earthA shower of damp clots and decaying leavesAnd a small thin hole,the size of a carrot.The Unnamed Fear,of which none are suffered,ever,to speak,has struck again.Odd how it is possible,even yet,to close one's eyes.To ignore. To Pretend.So long as it is some other rabbit;So long as it does not hit too close to home.
Within the burrow- our burrow- I wait.She does not return.
Nildro-hain...
No. Surely not.Surely,surely,she issimply above groundFeeding,gathering flayrahGetting better acquainted with the newcomers.Not my beautifulbelovedNildro-hain.
Day passesNi-Frith turns to late afternoonAnd still no Nildro-hain,no cherished mate appears.As the evening shadows lengthenI can deceive myself no longer.The others gather in the great burrowto talk;to exchange stories,poemsDarkness falls,over the fields and woodsOver my eyesOver my heart.
Dawn.Woken to a commotion,a clamor.The small,melancholy rabbit,him they call Fiver,is causing a disturbance.Despondent no longer,no trace of hesitationNow he is all energy,Calling out to rouse Frith and Inle;Yet he does not rouse the warren,save to a stony indifference.Quietly now I hear him tell Cowslip they are goingAwayTo the hills
Away! To the Hills!Something in the wordsbreaks though my tharn-struck grief.That's It! Suddenly I know:I have to follow. Somehow,I mustconvince them to let me come too
...There is nothing left for me here.
Blindly I race to catch them upDesperation driving me onThey may tear me to pieces-- no less than I deservefor the part I have played here-But that,or anything,is more endurablethan to remain behindin this warren of snares.
Take me with you!The plea of my soulechoes the words of the poet the night beforeIt is met withSilence.Rejection.An injunction to return-- to Nildro-hain!
The sound of her name pierces me through;It compels me to speak!To explain her fate,To win admittance to the group which isthe only possible life for me now,I force myself to say(what I can barely manage to whisper)the utterly forbidden words:
The wires.
Then.At last.Hazel.Welcome.A chance for a new startA new homeand to leave the past behind- Bereft... but,finally,free.
