Jacob was sitting in the livingroom. He was reading.
"No!" Jacob heard someone cry. It sounded like Emma. He closed his book.
"Please,no!" Emma cried. She sounded scared.
"Come on! Show him!" he heard Olive say.
"What's going on?" he asked. He heard a groan and several squeals of delight.
"E-mma!" Olive said dramatically. "He's going to love it!"
"He's going to laugh at me" Emma said.
"I don't really know what's going on,but for the record,Emma,I would never laugh at you" Jacob called up the stairs.
"See?" Olive said.
"What's going on here?" Miss Perigrine asked. She must have just walked in.
"I want Jacob to see Emma but she's not cooperating" Olive explained.
"I look ridiculous" Emma insisted.
Miss P. walked to the stairwell. "Emma,would you say that you and Jacob have a healthy relationship?"
"Yes" Emma said.
"I don't think Jacob cares about the way you look" Miss P. said. "I think he just cares about you."
Millard walked in. "What's going on?"
Jacob got him caught up.
"Olive" Millard called" do have you a good grip on her?"
"Yes" Olive said.
Millard walked up the stairs. There was a small shriek and a slight rustling noise.
Emma appeared at the foot of the stairs. Jacob felt his eyes go wide and his pupils dilate. She was beautiful. She was wearing a strapless green dress,her hair had been curled,and her lips had been painted maroon. Miss Perigrine smiled. "We'll just leave you two alone." She left,with Olive and Millard following closely behind her. They were alone now. Jacob walked up to her and placed two fingers under her chin.
"You look beautiful" he said. Emma blushed. "Thank you."
"Is there a reason for the new look?" Jacob asked.
Emma blushed even harder. "Olive thought it would be fun to give me a makeover. I didn't think she'd want you to see."
"I like it" he said. She smiled and turned around.
"Do you mind unzipping my dress?" she asked. Jacob smiled. He knew what was going to happen next. He unzipped it.
Emma said "Let me just wipe this stuff off my face."
She headed up to the bathroom. Jacob hurriedly began to unbutton his shirt.
