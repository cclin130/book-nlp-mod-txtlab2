Emma's POV
"Please don't be dead" I thought to myself desperately. Jacob had just fallen into the hollows pit while half of his body was in a hollows mouth. I could feel the hot tears sliding down my cheeks as I waited for him to climb back out and tell me he was alright,but he never did. I sobbed and when I went to try and get him out I felt an a hand on my arm holding me back,I turn my head and see it was miss Peregrine that had stopped me. I could see in her eyes that she was as horrified as I was. I start crying and feel the pain of losing someone I love all over again. First Abe now Jacob,I sobbed even harder as I realized I'd never see Jacob smile at me again or feel his warm embraces.
"Please don't be dead Jacob I can't lose you too" I think to myself as I sink to the floor. I feel miss Peregrine let go of me to allow me to grieve. Suddenly we hear the doors burst open and see the others running over to us. Realizing one of us is missing Millard speaks up.
"Where's Jacob?" he asked me. I sob and hide my face in my knees as I start to cry harder. I faintly hear miss Peregrine explain what happened but I'm too focused on my memories of Jacob to care. I remember when we took those pictures together on his phone by the cairn. I hear the others start to cry to as they begin to realize they'll never see him again. For what felt like days but it was really only a few hours we mourned the loss of our friend. Suddenly we hear something moving from the pit my love had fallen into. We all watch nervously as something moves from the shadows towards us. As soon as it's in the light we see that it's Jacob and he's floating. I feel like squealing and hugging him and never letting him go. Our eyes lock and he smiles at me.
"Thank the bird he's alright" I think to myself as I watch my love come over to us.
