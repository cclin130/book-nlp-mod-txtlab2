Prophecy
Come to me,boy searching ruins and do our will.
The ghost of past who wields the bow,
signed off his hate with blood.
Beware the secrets launched cursed arrow.
The phoenix will rise,
her feathers scorch the earth
before the beasts can pierce eyes.
Where cunning bones reach above the turf.
Bring your souls upon your dead.
The ground cracked
where those don't dare tread.
Birds fall,
flames rewrite the tale.
Tongues lashed to defend the wall.
Then time will stand still.
