I Am Alone
I am alone and rightly so
My name is J.D. Salinger short for Jerome David "J.D." Salinger
I lived a very private life for probably for almost half a century
Giving my last interview in 1980
I was an American writer who won acclaim early in life
Publishing my final original work in the year of 1965
