In that moment,
Wind tousled my hair,
And tinted my cheeks,
I felt the ground moving beneath me,and I was all too aware.
Electricity was crackling in the city and in my soul,
In that moment,I didn't have any worries or any thoughts about what I was to be,
I didn't have any life goal.
Because I was me,
And that was enough,
Even if I could be a little rough
Around the edges with
Too many things bubbling in my mind.
But in that moment I couldn't have been more perfect.
The moment was perfect itself.
Everything was alive and right and wrong and pure,
In that moment,
I was infinite,
I was so sure.
