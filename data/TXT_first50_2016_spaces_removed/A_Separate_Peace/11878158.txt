Nothing endures,not a tree,
"What I like best about this tree is that it's such a cinch!"
The tree seemed weary from age,enfeebled and dry
Not love,
Everyone has a moment that belongs particularly to him
Finny could shine with everyone,he attracted everyone he met
He also had particularly lost it for me,
I saw that right away.
We began to meet every night
Finny and I went back to our room
He turned to me
Under the low study lights our illegal radio broadcasted
Expressing a sincere emotion nakedly like that at Devon School was the next thing to suicide
Only Phineas could think up such a crazy idea
He of course saw nothing the slightest bit intimidating about it
He couldn't,or wouldn't admit it if he did
Why did I let Finny talk me into stupid things like this?
I never missed a meeting.
Not even a death by violence,
I did not cry even when I stood watching him being lowered into his family's burial ground outside of Boston
I could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral,and you do not cry in that case.
A/N:So,I had to write this for English and it kinda turned into this...? But if you made it this far,thanks for reading!
