A/N
The idea for this came from the Dune miniseries,namely Irulan's butterfly dress (huh,subtle),and her brief conversation with Paul. Admittedly I only know of this through Sfdebris,as I haven't seen the miniseries and know that meeting doesn't happen in the book,but hopefully it meets credulity standards.ButterflyAll walked forth into the hall.Men and women standing tall.Guests of the Atreides,Come to sup before their fall.…But blood had yet this land to mar,By Harkonens and Sardaukar.So dressed those of House Corrino,Came from distant,twinkling star.…Came down the ship from star-filled sky.To dine with those all marked to die.In went Princess Irulan,Dressed akin to butterfly.…And so they sat and so they ate,Guests began to congregate.But at the table,Leto's son,This planet,banter,so much hate.…So from the table,off went Paul,Sense of boredom not that small.And Irulan could sympathize,Knew too the sense of bloodline's walls.…So by a window they both talked,Of duty and the paths they walked.How freedom what was they desired,And how from duty they both baulked.…Words exchanged and secrets uttered,And Irulan felt sense of flutter.Perhaps the butterfly was free,But the cocoon let out a mutter.…Sardaukar,her jailers there,To lead away the princess fair.Out into the still of night,Out into Dune's cold frigid air.…She could not see,she could not scry,That those below were marked to die.Yet return Paul would,spill blood for blood,Bring war with sound of Fremen cries.…In time,at last,they'd meet again,Yet awaited her much grief and pain.One prison exchanged for another,And love lay lost,tears in rain.
