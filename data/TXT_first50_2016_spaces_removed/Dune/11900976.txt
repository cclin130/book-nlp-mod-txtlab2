Brother DearestI miss you more than words can say,I miss you more each passing day.I listen for you in the night,Under stars that twinkle bright.…I imagine you within the sand,Among the sandworms once so grand.I think of you in fields of green,A landscape that you'd find obscene.…Alia,she tightens grasp,Dune knows war just like in past.I see the banners flying grand,I think of water spilt on sand.…Grandmother is in my mind,Although her none of us can find.Irulan,I too give thought,As battle wages,deaths for naught.…To father too,my mind it flies,To he who lost the use of eyes.What if he once more saw this world?As his war once more unfolds?…And yet my thoughts come back to you,Brother dearest,soulmate too.Hope and pray I see you soon,For empty is this world called Dune.
