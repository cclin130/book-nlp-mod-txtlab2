There's only teeth and tongue and the scent of one another and the realization that we only need each other.
There's the echoing of the word mine mine mine in the backs of our minds because we know that we belong to one another and no force could change that.
There's the thundering of our hearts that beat in time with each other and the blood that flows through our veins testify that we are one and we are burning.
We're burning so intensely that we've felt the temperature raise to an ungodly number and we're melting into one another because we're here,and we're so caught up in living living living.
We make each other feel so alive,like every single nerve ending is sparking and the burning is probably coming from the sparks because now there's a fire and we don't think we'll ever be able to put it out. We don't want to put it out.
That fire represents all that we've accomplished. We finally have each other and we're never letting go because without this,without us,we'd never be warm again. There would be no fire left in us at all.
But this is a blazing inferno. It's the best description we have to being able to explain what we have found within one another because there are no other words. So we compare our love to something that crackles and burns and changes colors because this was something that was spontaneous and unexpected and catastrophically beautiful.
Love love love. When two people who each believe they deserve nothing come together and find solace and meaning. That,that is what makes life worth living. When we find someone worth fighting for. We have the love that is ground breaking;earth shattering. Our love could move mountains and still seas.
But we didn't realize this. All that mattered was the wandering hands and the quick breaths. The pressure of our bodies against one another and the reassurance that this was real,we were real,and we were happy.
