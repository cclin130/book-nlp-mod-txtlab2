Close your eyes,Darling
 I will watch the shadows
Think of the light shone
 I reflect on dark it casts
Take your day,Darling
 While I will take the night
Do not pity me
For my choice with you
I will teach you,Darling
The truth about life
 What you must remember
Do not be afraid of the dark
 Or reckless in the light
Close your eyes,Darling
 I will watch the shadows
Think of the light shone
 I reflect on dark cast
Take your day,Darling
 While I will take the night
You never know,when the evil will strike
You cannot expect joy to come
 There is charm in the bluebird
And beauty in the nightingale 
 Sun for day
But moon for night
Songs will scare
The bad away
 'Till none stays
Close your eyes,Darling
 I will watch the shadows
Think of the light shone
 I reflect on dark cast
Take your day,Darling
 While I will take the night
My Darling,fly with me always 
during your glorious day
Oh,my love will protect you 
during my exquisite night
Poetry and Lyrics are not where my talent lies. But this happened,and I figured,why not?
