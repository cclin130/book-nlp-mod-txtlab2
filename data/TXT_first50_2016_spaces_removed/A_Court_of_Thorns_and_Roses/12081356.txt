I have been so worried about feyre. i hope she's ok. i will kill that bastard for doing whatever he did to feyre. i was walking through the hall to get to feyre's room and see that she is standing by the window.
" feyre,are you ok?"
"of course why wouldn't i be?"
"i've just been so worried about you and you have been very distant"
"love,its just that i cant remember what rhys did to me and I've been worried about my sisters that i haven't had enough time to cope with whats happened."
"you know you can always come to me"

"you know you can always come to me"
Did he really just say that? what about when you locked me in my room and kept me in there like a caged animal,she wanted to scream but she didn't cause she could feel rhys stroking down the bond to calm her.
"I know which is why i wanted to tell you that i needed more paints,papers,pens and easels."
"i can get you paints and easels but why papers and pens."
"when i was in the night court,rhys taught me how to read and write."
"ok,and i know you don't want me sleeping with you but please just open up to me."
no,she wanted to say but instead she said " i hope so soon but not to day or this week please."
OK so i realized i should have elaborated on the first chapter but i hope you liked this chapter.
