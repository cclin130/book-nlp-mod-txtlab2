In the Court of Spring I sought my own damnation,
in the Court of Dreams I found my salvation.
Because starlight lit my soul,and in his sickly golden light I was dim.
For in time I learned that I harbored a love for another him.
He was darkness and night,
and when he soared he took me with him to witness the sight,
of another world that I had been blind to before.
I learned and found myself to be not a chore.
Instead,I was kind,brave,intelligent and I was selfless,
All the golden one found me to be was selfish.
I was a puppet that refused to be patronized and pulled by it's strings,
until I was freed and given a pen so I could write my own endings.
If he was the Night then I despised the Sun,
for I shone more brightly in his darkness than the other's illuminated one.
In the Court of Dreams I found my salvation,
And now in the Court of Spring I sought out the Sun's damnation.
