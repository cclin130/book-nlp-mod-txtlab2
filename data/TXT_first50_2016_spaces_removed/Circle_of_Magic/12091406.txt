Spring
It began as a meeting of the minds - impassioned,intellectual debate that slowly led to passion of a different kind.
Summer
The summer sun beat down on the greenhouse,heating up the glass,as the swirling mist inside enveloped the two men in its warm embrace,protecting them from the prying eyes of the outside world.
Autumn
The brown,dying leaves outside reflected his mood,he thought glumly,sitting by himself in his greenhouse,not realising that halfway around the world his lover was watching the same harvest moon and thinking the same lonely thoughts.
Winter
The cold wind blew a chill through his bright robes,but it didn't cut as deep as the icicle forming in his heart as he looked down at the grave of his one-time lover and friend,gone too soon,but never to be forgotten in his heart.
