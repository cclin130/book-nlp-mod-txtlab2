p style="text-align:center;"Thy kiss is sweet like thy rose;br / Thy cheeks are pink like the morning blossom,br / Thy hair so smooth and curled,it shames the loveliest silk br / But thy breath is short,and thy darkened eyes go dim as my Angel smile one more time br / As one more tear slips from her soft blue eyes her grip upon my hand is lost to me br / As it falls as her whisper was to me. "Find me" I whisper back "I shall never stop",br / As her light shone through,the last glimmer fades from the gate way to her soul,one memory slips through my eyes./p
