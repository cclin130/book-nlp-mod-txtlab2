P. is my first fanfiction opus,and i did it with a lot of assessment and love many years tough to it needed a lot of bravery to come to this today,as strange as it seems.
Please,be always be:).Ι'm not from USA or UK so English is not my native language,and this poem,beside all my love to this,is quite simple,and i have make some,be kind;)THE MASQUE OF RED DEATHBeware when all is luminous,beware when all is perfectly gorgeous,outside the dark is near,and the cold wind blows heavily,so you can't hear,the groans and the tears from outsidethe merry atmosphere.Inside the joy of humans beatinginto the heart of a dance of madness,like lunatical butterflies the peoplelost in masks,made in happiness and sadness,behind of them.Because they can't handle them.So they hide,and leave the good with the eviland the cheer with the pain around to collide,like stars which has come their time.life is short and the feelingsa natural wrong.Who says that nature is perfect,life is fair and so its beings?Romantic fool you continue to believing.Soul is one of the childish fantasies,and the human resistancesbecome less and lesswith the chances.Don't spend them only to a consciencethat you can't see and admire,or to a heart that's useless and betrays youwhen comes your time.Enjoy yourself now that you're alive,and let the others peacefully die.The clock is ticking,The time comes and goes,Suddenly something has change into the roomand the eternal music with its undying spirit die,Men and women become statues,and becoming smaller and smaller shadows in walls,watching the doom.Yes,you can see.Your vision is back,but not and the balance of your mind.Your eyes,your soul freezing here.A presence from hell is standing high,dominates with a unworldly power the audienceat his feet,and he's guiding the horror of his silence around you this night.It's true.The Red Death is here tonight.You can't stare at him,but you know that alwayshe'll stare at you.Because you won't admit,but he knows you better than you do,and he sees deeper in you than your reflexion,inside the mirror that you see through.He is your unspoken past,your uncontrolled presentand your unbelievable future.He's the hideous side of justicewhen we all die,the cruel panishment for our own sinsthat lives inside of our most horrible dreams,when death has the reins,and life was only a running journey,elusive and ardentlike a flame.He remembers us the humanity before the immortality.The lights with no warning blow outand darkness falls everywhere,every element of life is ending with you now,and you're leaving your last breathwith no powers to cry out.With your last gaze to be in the bloody masterwith no mercy.The Red death within the mask of the deadsand the tragic fate and hate inside himlike Hamletbefore his meeting with the boatmanfor the depths of the Kingdom of Hades and Persephone,is here tonight.and he always be,into the shadows of the nightime.
