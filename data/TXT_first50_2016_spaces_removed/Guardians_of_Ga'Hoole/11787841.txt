I've been thinking of writing guardians of ga'hoole fanfiction for a while now,but never got round to it. And now I have! Yay! Hope you like the prologue
Nyra looked at the shattered fragments of eggshell at her feet. She nudged them gently with her talon.
"Your Pureness,we must move on. There is a rolling bed of embers moving towards us. And the tree"-Uglamore looked up at the tree from which the egg had dropped-"it's about to fall. There will be more eggs in the future,your pureness,rest assured."
"I am assured but I shall not rest. And I vow to kill eglantine if it is the last thing I ever do." Her once-white face was almost black now with soot. She flapped her wings once,twice and rose in the air. "Kill! Kill! Kill Eglantine,the betrayer,murderer of the sacred orb!"
But in her anger,Nyra had not noticed the light speckles of a spotted owl egg.
Hope you liked it! Its my first guardians fanfic,so I'm a bit nervous,but I hope I do well! Please review if you liked the prologue!
