Father
You who I did call father of mine
There was nothing that I wanted except for love
But you were afraid and did decline
And all my life I was left and starved
You abandoned me in my time of need
Overcome by your own grieve
You made me wander the earth on my own feet
What was it that I was meant to believe?
At first I was afraid of every thing
Yearning for friendship I learned your way of life
Later on there was only horror I could bring
Because you did not give me a wife
And now that you have left this Earth
I shall go and end my curse.
