How can you talk to me in such malicious ways like you do,when you barely understand my troubles? Yes I killed that boy,but I suffered so long and hard,I can't even consider my actions wrong. What happened was at the fault of you wicked,condescending,vile,humans.
It was their disgust and hatred,their cold dead hearts,that drove me to my actions. Even the most pure are to be blamed. I was wounded,abandoned,rejected,and that was the reward of my benevolence. It was beyond what your mind can comprehend. That pain devours,it's imbedded into your soul. I couldn't control it,and I shouldn't have to be punished further for that. And those that deny its existence are only fueling it.
One might say that I am only hurting myself. And they are right. But there was no choice for me. I was angry,upset,and tired of it all. And just when I thought I could find peace,I was struck in the heart even further. There is nothing left inside,and the last thing I need is more torture. How can one can live a life alone and broken like I did,and not follow my path?
The worst part is,they all speak the truth. I am a monster. But that was not in my control,and there was nothing for me to do. I don't ask for your absolution. I don't ask for your acceptance. All I want is for you to listen,listen and think about this before you judge me.
Author's Note:This was done as a monologue with a time limit (which was why it was so short.)
