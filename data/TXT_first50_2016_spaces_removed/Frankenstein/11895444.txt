Out of fear rose anger and anger hate,
Our of the gate a monster we create
From love you made despair,
Beyond repair he wanders the earth
Without purpose wondering about,
Its never-ending rejection and self-reflection.
Had you upon this earth,
Shown compassion
You may have set forth,
A different tone of your own,
Rather than the destruction
You have sown,
In ignorance we create instruments of destruction,
And without instruction recreate the abhorrence,
We fought so hard to defeat
